                                    (1) The anti-trust statute of Missouri does not infringe upon the liberty of the citizen to contract concerning his
                                    property and prohibit him the enjoyment of his property and impose restraints and burdens upon it without due
                                    process of law. Road Co. v. Sanford, 164 U.S. 592; Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. State, 44 H. R. W. R. 938; U. S. v.
                                    Joint Traffic Ass'n, 171 U.S. 505. These statutes are founded upon a proper exercise of the general police authority
                                    of the State. Beach on Trusts and Monopolies, sec. 13; Munn v. Illinois, 94 U.S. 124; Railroad v. Beckwith, 129 U.S.
                                    29; State v. Moore, 104 N. C. 710; Thorp v. Railroad, 27 Vt. 140; Bertholf v. O'Rielly, 74 N. Y. 521. The State, in the
                                    exercise of this power in the selection of remedies looking to the suppression of evil and harm to its people, may
                                    apply them to the most sacred contracts and to the uses of property of every description, not in the way of an
                                    arbitrary spoliation or confiscation in the capricious exercise of the police power, but a useful regulation in the
                                    interest of the public welfare. Cooley's [***2]  Const. Lim. (6 Ed.), pp. 707-720. In enumerating subjects which are
                                    acted upon by the State in the exercise of its police power, a late writer on limitations of police powers names
                                    combinations in restraint of trade. In U. S. v. Trans-Missouri Freight Ass'n, 166 U.S. 322, the court said: ""While the
                                    statute prohibits all combinations in the form of trusts or otherwise, the limitation is not confined to that form alone.

                                    All combinations which are in restraint of trade or commerce are prohibited, whether in the form of trusts or in any
                                    other form whatever."" Tiedeman on Lims. of Police Powers, sec. 96a; Railroad v. Mathews, 165 U.S. 16; Crowley v.
                                    Christenson, 137 U.S. 89. The Federal Supreme Court has decided that it was not the design of the Fourteenth
                                    Amendment to the Constitution of the United States to interfere with the just and proper exercise of the police power
                                    by the States. Barbier v. Connolly, 113 U.S. 31; Davis v. Mass, 167 U.S. 47; Oil Co. v. State, 44 S. W. Rep. 938. (2)
                                    If legislative authority does exist to restrain the conduct of owners of property in a particular way in the use of their
                                    property so as to work injury to the public welfare, and the legislature has acted [***3]  in the manner required by
                                    the Constitution in passing laws, then due process of law exists in so far as it is necessary to find legal authority for
                                    passing a statute similar to our anti-trust act, prohibiting all combinations in restraint of trade. Legal restraint
                                    imposed upon the use of property does not deprive the owner of it of due process of law. Railroad v. Mathews, 165

                                    constitution, as being class legislation. U. S. v. Pipe Co., 85 Fed. Rep. 285; Association v. Houck, 27 S. W. Rep.

                                    the main purpose of a lawful contract and necessary to protect the covenantee in the enjoyment of the legitimate
                                    fruits of the contract or to protect him from the dangers of an unjust use of those fruits by the other party. U. S. v.

                                    Where a corporation uses its franchises for the purpose of establishing a trust, or enters into a trust to create a
                                    monopoly and stifle competition, the State can forfeit the corporate franchise. People v. North River Sugar Refining

                                    inaugurated in the city of St. Joseph was intended to and did constitute a monopoly in the fixing of insurance rates
                                    in the hands of the respondent companies because it created a common rate and abolished competition. The
                                    ""Social Club"" fixed the rate of insurance and dominated the business. This created a trust. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v.

                                    foreign insurance corporations, in entering into a combination to fix rates of insurance in violation of the antitrust
                                    law, bind the corporations where reports are made to the companies [***7]  and they accept the benefits of said

                                    exist for the reason that it has reduced the prices of insurance, even though such were true. That policy may be

                                    necessary to crush competition. Such combinations have been frequently condemned by courts as unlawful and
                                    against public policy. Hoeker v. Vandewater, 4 Denio 349; Stanton v. Allen, 5 Denio 434; Coal Co. v. Coal Co., 68

                                    numerous cases restrictions have been condemned, notwithstanding they produced for a while the lowering of

                                    (1) This suit is in the nature of a public accusation, and if the State makes out its case, the judgment is penal, and in
                                    such case the burden of proof is upon the State to prove the charges [***8]  as alleged. 5 Thompson's Com. on

                                    that the Underwriters' Social Club of St. Joseph, Mo., was not created, formed or organized, conducted or carried
                                    on for the purpose of fixing or maintaining rates of insurance in that city, or for the purpose of controlling rates of
                                    insurance in any respect, and that it did not either fix, control or maintain rates of insurance according to Fetter's
                                    estimates. Anderson v. U. S., 171 U.S. 604. (3) None of the respondents authorized directed or acquiesced in the
                                    acts of their local agents, in becoming members of the Underwriters' Social Club of St. Joseph, Mo., during the
                                    period covered by this suit, and none of the defendants, were aware or informed at any time prior to the production
                                    of this suit, that said club was engaged in the business of fixing or maintaining rates of fire insurance, or in any way,
                                    charged with doing same, in the city of St. Joseph, Mo. (4) The information filed by relator, does not state facts

                                    1891, as amended by the Acts of April 11, 1895, and March 24, 1897, is repugnant to the Constitution of the State
                                    of Missouri, for the following reasons: First. It infringes the provisions of section 28 of article IV, which provides that
                                    no bill shall contain more than one subject, which shall be clearly expressed in its title. State v. Schofield, 41 Mo.

                                    Mass. 92; Hooper v. California, 155 U.S. 655. Second. It violates section 30 of article II, which provides that no
                                    person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law. State v. Loomis, 115 Mo. 316; State

                                    that section 1, of said Act, is violative of section [***10]  1 of the XIVth Amendment to the Constitution of the United
                                    States, which provides that no State shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law,
                                    nor deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law, in this, that each of said companies
                                    having fully complied with the laws of the State, having paid the fees, made all the deposits, secured the necessary
                                    license required by law, they were each authorized to do business in this State, under the protection of the laws of
                                    the State, and that said Act deprives them of the right to carry on their business in a fair and just manner among
                                    themselves and not in any manner injurious to the public or any other person in the State, and deprives them of the
                                    right of making necessary and reasonable contracts relating to the business of insurance, and discriminates against
                                    them and in favor of other domestic and foreign fire insurance companies who are not embraced within the terms of
                                    said law. Duncan v. Missouri, 152 U.S. 377; Marchant v. Railroad, 153 U.S. 390; Barbier v. Connolly, 113 U.S. 27;

                                    The clause, sec. 5, ch. 88, laws 1900, ""If such other corporation be engaged in the same kind of business and be a
                                    competitor therein,"" applies to both of the clauses preceding it--that is to say, it applies as well to the clause against
                                    a corporation, acquiring the capital stock of other corporations, as to the clause against a corporation acquiring the
                                    franchise, plant or equipments of other corporations. It is one entire sentence, with simply a comma before the word
                                    ""nor."" Ordinary grammatical construction of the sentence will demonstrate this.
                                    Bearing in mind that the law under consideration was passed to define trusts and combines, and to provide for the
                                    suppression thereof, and to preserve to the people of this state the benefits derived from competition; and
                                    remembering that a trust or combination could not be created by one corporation,  [***2]  engaged in a certain kind
                                    of business, acquring part or all of the capital stock of another corporation, engaged in a different kind of business,
                                    the unsoundness of the attorney-general's contention is apparent.
                                    If the attorney-general's construction of this law is correct, a corporation may purchase the franchise, plant and
                                    equipments of a noncompetitive corporation, thereby getting absolute control of the whole thing with full power to
                                    dictate its full policy, and yet he would not allow the same corporation to purchase one share of stock in a
                                    noncompetitive corporation, in which latter event, its interest would be so small that it would have no control over its
                                    policy.
                                    The effect of the construction contended for by the attorney-general will be looked to by the court in construing the
                                    statute. This is more extensive and far reaching than may appear at first view. Upon such construction an
                                    incorporated bank could not invest its surplus in the stock of any railroad company or other corporations, whose
                                    stock is quoted and sold every day in the stock exchanges of the country.
                                    No insurance company could invest its surplus or earnings in the stock of any other corporation [***3]  whatever.
                                    Savings banks, incorporated, would be restricted in their business investments to bonds or mortgages, and the
                                    stock exchanges of the world would be closed against them. In a word, every corporation in this state incorporated
                                    by the state, would be shut out of every stock exchange in the world, so far as dealings in stocks are concerned.
                                    The interest of the individual stockholder would be seriously and injuriously affected by such a construction. No
                                    stockholder could sell his stock to a Mississippi corporation, but could only sell to individuals. Nor could any
                                    78 Miss. 831, *831; 29 So. 514, **514; 1901 Miss. LEXIS 131, ***1
                                    
                                    
                                    stockholder borrow money from any incorporated bank or financial institution in the state on his stock as collateral
                                    security, for no bank would take as collateral security a certificate of stock that it could not own.
                                    The purpose to effect such extensive and radical changes in the business in the state cannot reasonably be
                                    attributed to the legislature.
                                    Monroe McClurg, attorney-general, pro se.
                                    An attorney-general, in giving his opinions to the governor as to whether a proposed charter is violative of the
                                    constitution and laws of the state, should resolve all doubts against the proposed charter for [***4]  the same reason
                                    that the courts determine doubtful questions as to whether corporations possess certain powers against the
                                    corporation. All grants of power by the sovereign are to be strictly construed against the grant. The best
                                    interpretation of the law is the law itself. Section 8 of chapter 88 of the laws of 1900 is too plain and unambiguous to
                                    call for aids of construction outside of its own clear and logical language and meaning. The clear purpose and intent
                                    of the statute, as gathered from its own language, is (1) to deny the right to any corporation, as such, to purchase or
                                    own any of the capital stock of any other corporation, and (2) to deny one corporation the right to purchase or to
                                    acquire the franchise, plant or equipments of a competing corporation.
                                    No man can conceive of a more powerful scheme for forming the most powerful combinations than that contended
                                    for by appellants. A single bank or a railroad company, a telegraph, express or telephone company might subscribe
                                    for or in some other manner ""purchase or own"" a majority of the capital stock of every noncompeting corporation in
                                    the state, and allow such other corporations to share in its stocks and profits. Nor [***5]  is it easier to find a better
                                    illustration than the charter under consideration. A gravel company, organized for the purpose of owning and
                                    operating gravel pits, together with all other powers incidental thereto and necessary to the successful operation of
                                    the gravel pits, demands the power to ""purchase, subscribe for, take and hold, sell and deal in the stock of and
                                    shares of the capital stock of any corporation, joint stock company or association organized under or chartered by
                                    the laws of any state of the United States, or under or by the laws of the United States; Provided, Such corporation,
                                    association or joint stock company is not a competitor or engaged in the same kind of business."" How can such
                                    powers reasonably conduce to the lawful operation of a gravel pit? Who can imagine the extent of such powers?
                                    We must presume that full advantage will be taken of every power granted.
                                    Section 883 of the code requires ""clear and definite statement of the purposes for which the corporation is created .
                                    . . and the powers to be exercised."" Here it is clearly and definitely stated that the purpose is to operate a ""gravel
                                    pit,"" and it may be expected that all powers necessary to the [***6]  successful operation of the pit should be
                                    granted, but nothing beyond that. So that, looking to this statute merely as a side light by which to read section 5 of
                                    the act of 1900, it is made the more evident that the power to invest in the capital stock of other noncompeting
                                    corporations is not within the reasonable contemplation of the powers to successfully operate a gravel pit."

                                    The court erred in rendering a judgment for the defendant and in failing to render a judgment for the State forfeiting
                                    the charter of the defendant corporation, because the evidence established the fact, as found by the court, that the
                                    defendant had misused and abused its powers in violation of the policy and of the Constitution [***5]  and laws of
                                    the State, and had usurped and exercised powers not conferred upon it, in a manner that produces injury to the
                                    public by affecting the welfare of the people, in this: (a) That it acquired and thereby brought under one
                                    management and prevented and is preventing competition between existing competing cotton compresses, the
                                    same being competing aids to commerce.  (b) That it acquired and thereby brought under one ownership and
                                    management existing competing cotton compresses, the same being competing aids to commerce, for the purpose
                                    of closing them down.  (c) That it acquired and thereby brought under one ownership and management existing
                                    competing cotton compresses, the same being competing aids to commerce, and thereby created and is now
                                    maintaining a monopoly in the business of compressing cotton.
                                    A corporate franchise is granted and held upon condition that it be exercised for the attainment of the objects
                                    specified, and when a corporation is guilty of acts contrary to either the statute or common law, the charter of the
                                    corporation may be forfeited.  Rev. Stats., art. 3528; Insurance Co. v. State, 86 Texas, 274; 1 Eddy on

                                    A corporation which exceeds its powers in any important particular commits a breach of an implied condition of the

                                    At the hearing of this case in the District Court and on its submission in the appellate court it was assumed that the
                                    anti-trust statutes of 1889 and 1895 were valid, but the Court of Civil Appeals, following the holding of the Supreme
                                    Court of the United States in the case of Connally v. Union Sewer Pipe Company, based their decision, affirming
                                    the judgment appealed from, upon the ground that each of these enactments were unconstitutional.  It is
                                    respectfully submitted that the constitutionality of the statutes referred to is not involved in this case, the sole
                                    purpose of which is to forfeit the charter of the defendant corporation.
                                    A charter of a corporation is a contract [***7]  between the sovereignty which grants it and the incorporators.  The
                                    State grants a charter subject to any conditions which it may see proper to impose.  It could reserve the right to
                                    repeal the charter at any time and for any reason, or without reason.  4 Thomp. on Corp., sec. 4512.  When the
                                    corporators accept the charter they accept it subject to this right, and are estopped from raising the question of the
                                    legality of the terms of the contract which they have made.  There is no difference in this respect between the
                                    charter of a domestic corporation and the permit granted to a foreign corporation authorizing it to transact business
                                    within the State.
                                    In the case of the Waters Pierce Oil Company v. State of Texas, 177 United States, 28, in which the constitutionality
                                    of the Texas anti-trust statutes of 1889 and 1895 were presented, the Supreme Court of the United States held that
                                    it was immaterial whether they were constitutional or not; that although discriminations were imposed by these
                                    statutes (discriminations which have since been held by the same court to have rendered the law nugatory), still the
                                    corporation acceded to the conditions (however reasonable or unreasonable, discriminatory [***8]  or otherwise
                                    they may have been) upon which the State was willing to and did grant it the desired permit, and that for the
                                    violation of these conditions the permit could be canceled.  If the Waters Pierce Oil Company had been a domestic
                                    corporation its charter could have been canceled as its permit was, and this entirely regardless of the question as to
                                    whether or not the statutes of 1889 and 1895 were constitutional.
                                    In the case of Connally v. Union Sewer Pipe Company, 184 United States, 540, it is expressly stated by the justice
                                    who rendered the opinion of that court, that if the defendant in that case had been a domestic corporation its charter
                                    could have been forfeited.  This is entirely in accord with the decision in the case of the Waters Pierce Oil Company
                                    v. State, and is in line with the holding of the courts, including the Supreme Court of the United States.  Doyle v.

                                    The Legislature did not intend by the acts of 1889 and 1895, or either of them, to prohibit the organization of
                                    corporations for the purpose of purchasing competing properties.  That end was sought to be attained only by the
                                    Act of 1899, which does not include compress companies within its aims.  Anti-Trust Acts 1889; Anti-Trust Act

                                    It was not unlawful for the promoters of the defendant corporation [***10]  to procure the charter in question, it being

                                    shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its
                                    jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, and are therefore void.
                                    Since the statutes are in contravention of the Federal Constitution, they are absolutely void, and can not authorize
                                    the forfeiture of defendant's charter, or be given any effect whatever as laws.

                                    The transactions in question are not illegal under the common law, and if they were, the penalty of forfeiture could
                                    not be inflicted.
                                    Even if the anti-trust statutes are entitled to any effect whatever in this case, they are not applicable to the
                                    occupation or service of compressing cotton, for there being no element of barter or sale involved, combinations
                                    affecting that business are not prohibited by such statutes.
                                    The anti-trust statutes of this State were not intended to prohibit the purchase and sale of property where the
                                    restriction of competition is merely an incident but not the controlling object and purpose.  An intent to suppress or
                                    restrict competition is the gist of the offenses denounced by the statute;  [***13]  and no such intent appears in this
                                    case.
                                    Rates for the compression of cotton are subject to regulation by the Railroad Commission, and are therefore not
                                    within the operation of the anti-trust statutes in any event."

                                    The Missouri statute, article 1, chapter 143, Revised Statutes 1899, has been passed upon by this court and held
                                    valid and constitutional. State ex inf. Firemens' Fund Insurance Co., 152 Mo. 45. Such laws have been adjudged
                                    constitutional by the United States Supreme Court. United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association, 171 U.S.
                                    173 Mo. 356, *356; 73 S.W. 645, **645; 1903 Mo. LEXIS 257, ***1
                                    
                                    
                                    558. The following State Supreme Courts have also held such laws constitutional: People v. Shealen, 139 N. Y.
                                    251; Missouri River Coal Co., v. Barclay Coal Co., 68 Pa. St. 173; Central Ohio Salt Co. v. Guthrie, 35 Ohio St. 666;

                                    Ann. 168. The acts of the managers and salesmen and agents of respondents bind the corporations. A corporation
                                    can only act through agents, and if the agents' acts or practices are in violation of law, the [***2]  corporation must
                                    suffer the consequences. A corporation can and must control its agents and must see at its peril that its agents do
                                    not violate the law while attending to the business of the company. 152 Mo. 38. The Supreme Court of Missouri, as
                                    well as the courts of other States, hold that a corporation is liable for the acts of its agents, committed while in the
                                    prosecution of the company's business entrusted to their care, although the act is unknown to the president or
                                    board of directors of the corporation. 152 Mo. 381; 47 Mo. 442; 75 Mo. 325; 48 Mo. 152; 3 Mo. App. 442; 2 Mo.

                                    150 Mo. 113. The officer or agent of the corporation represents the corporation when he is acting within the scope
                                    of his duties, and his knowledge, while so engaged, with reference to matters pertaining to that branch of the
                                    business of the corporation, is the knowledge of the corporation. Elliott on Private Corporations, 247. The
                                    admissions and statements of an agent made while he is acting in the course of the performance of his duties as
                                    agent, with reference to any existing state of affairs [***3]  of the business in which he is engaged, become a part of
                                    the res gestae and are clearly admissible against the principal. 48 Mo. 41. In this case, however, no effort has been
                                    made to show that the president and board of directors and the chief officers of the corporation did not have
                                    knowledge of the acts of their agents in fixing, maintaining and controlling the prices of the packers' products in this
                                    State. In the insurance cases, the officers of the companies were put upon the stand and they testified that the acts
                                    of the agents were without authority from them and that they knew nothing of them, but the court held that as the
                                    company received the benefit of the acts of the agents and that as the agents were entrusted with the care and
                                    conduct of the business of the corporation in this state, their acts bound the corporation. In the case at bar, there is
                                    no such denial made by the president and board of directors of the corporation, and respondents stand silent in the
                                    face of the proof of the facts that their general managers and salesmen who were entrusted with the conduct of
                                    their business and the sale and disposition of their products direct to the butchers and the consuming [***4]  public
                                    in this State, made and entered into a combination to fix, regulate, maintain and control the prices to be paid for
                                    dressed beef, pork and cured meats. The acts of agents of a corporation within the scope of their employment are
                                    the acts of the corporation, and are evidence against it. The Supreme Court of this State in 1871, in the case of
                                    Northrup v. Mississippi Valley Ins. Co., 47 Mo. 442, said: ""A corporation acts through its officers; and the
                                    admissions of such officers made in the execution of the duties imposed upon them concerning matters in which
                                    they are called upon to act, and which matter is within the scope of the authority usually exercised by them, are
                                    evidence against the corporation."" Pitts v. Steele Mercantile Company, 75 Mo. App. 232. Declarations and
                                    admissions of officers and agents of a corporation are admissible in evidence against the corporation for any
                                    purpose for which and under the same circumstances under which declarations and admissions of a natural person
                                    are admissible against him, although neither expressly authorized or ratified by the corporation, if they were made
                                    by an officer or agent in the course of a transaction on behalf of the corporation,  [***5]  and within the scope of his
                                    general power. 3 Clark & Marshall on Corporations, pp. 2216, 2217, 2218; Kirkstall Brewery Co. v. Railroad, L. R.

                                    of the packers' product is proven in this case. The proof of this express agreement as to the fresh pork is competent
                                    evidence against each of the respondents tending to prove the conspiracy between respondents to fix, regulate and
                                    control the price to be paid for dressed beef, because it proves an unlawful agreement and relationship to exist
                                    between respondents with reference to carrying on a portion of the business that they all engaged in, to-wit, the
                                    pork business. 38 Oh. St. 581; 46 [***6]  Mich. 268; 2 Day (Conn.) 205; 25 Conn. 486; 6 T. R. 527; 2 Esp. N. 719;

                                    the State is not required to prove that the agreement was made in express terms to fix and maintain the prices of
                                    dressed beef. State v. Walker, 98 Mo. 104; United States v. Ringskoff, 6 Bissell (U.S.) 259; United States v.

                                    Sanner, 40 Pa. St. 9. An agreement between conspirators may be implied or expressed. 2 Fed. 754; 67 Fed. 698;
                                    44 Fed. 896; 89 Ala. 121; Spies v. People, 122 Ill. 170; 6 Am. and Eng. Ency. of Law, 840. Where corporations
                                    receive the benefit of the acts of the agents and the fruits of the business transacted by them, the corporations are
                                    bound by the agents' acts. 44 S. W. 936; Elliott on Pri. Corp., sec. 247; 152 Mo. 37; 144 Mo. 420. It is [***7]  not
                                    necessary to invoke the provisions of section 8971, Revised Statutes 1899, making acts of a foreign corporation
                                    prima facie proof of the act of the corporation, and the State invokes no prima facie presumptions under this statute,
                                    because agency of the managers and salesmen of respondents has been proven in this case just as it would be in
                                    any other where the question of the fact of agency is to be determined. If a conspiracy to fix, maintain, regulate and
                                    control the prices to be paid for dressed pork, beef and cured meats between respondents and others has been
                                    proven, then the acts and declarations of one of the respondents or its agents in the conduct of the business of
                                    respondent, is evidence against all of the respondents. 98 Mo. 104; 2 Pet. (U.S.) 359; 91 U.S. 426; 144 U.S. 263;
                                    44 Fed. 896; 67 Fed. 698; 7 Wall. (U.S.) 132; 22 C. C. A. 104; 124 Mo. 1; 116 Mo. 605; Spies v. People, 3 Am. St.

                                    criminal cases. 43 N. H. 36. The facts proven show a violation of the common law of Missouri by the respondents.
                                    Combinations and agreements which destroy or have a tendency [***8]  to destroy competition in trade, by fixing,
                                    regulating and controlling the price of a commodity, are illegal at common law. 140 Ill. 80; 171 Ill. 484; 170 Ill. 551;
                                    121 N. Y. 582. And if we had no antitrust statute in Missouri, the facts established in this case would make the
                                    respondents guilty of an unlawful combination and agreement at common law. 85 Fed. 282. Our Legislature has a
                                    right to declare, and has declared, that all corporations, foreign as well as domestic, violating our antitrust act, shall
                                    forfeit their right to do business in Missouri. 100 Mass. 531; 10 Wal. 410; 28 Oh. St. 521; 6 Kans. 245; 152 Mo. 1.

                                    (1) The report is founded upon hearsay and incompetent evidence. Adams v. Railroad, 74 Mo. 513; 1 Greenl. Ev.
                                    (14 Ed.), sec. 114; 1 Am. and Eng. Ency. Law (2 Ed.), 695; Dorne v. Mfg. Co., 11 Cush. (Mass.) 205; Barber v.
                                    Bennett, 62 Vt. 50. The res gestae was the sale to the butcher -- not as to whether the principal was in some
                                    combination. There was no pretense that the persons who made the statements had formed a combination, but the
                                    statement was that some one else higher in authority did so. (2)  [***9]  It is only fair to the commissioner to say that
                                    his idea must have been that the doctrine of the Insurance Cases, 152 Mo. 1, was that no corporation charged with
                                    a violation of the antitrust law could question the authority of any employee, and hence all statements of all
                                    employees could be shown. Such a rule applies to no other kind of case and would make such a discrimination as
                                    would deprive respondents of the protection of the fourteenth amendment to the Federal Constitution. The
                                    Insurance Cases teach no such doctrine, for the rule is as stated in 9 Am. and Eng. Ency. of Law (2 Ed.), 590.

                                    Batchelder v. Emery, 20 N. H. 165. (3) The alleged high prices in beef at the time of filing of the information was
                                    because of the high price of the live animals. The testimony on this subject is: The prices of the live animal
                                    controlled the price of the fresh meat. When the price of the live animal went up the price of the fresh meat likewise
                                    increased. It so happened that [***10]  in the spring of 1902 the prices were unusually large, based on the short
                                    supply of cattle, and the high price of grain and the drouth. The testimony of R. H. Allen is especially valuable in this
                                    connection and it finds strong support in the article of Fred C. Croxton, one of statisticians of the United States
                                    Bureau of Statistics, entitled: ""The Advance in Beef Prices,"" found in the January, 1903, number of the Review of
                                    Reviews (pp. 69-74.) Many of the State's witnesses expressly conceded that the advance in price was only in
                                    accordance with the advance in the price of the live animal. (4) The Attorney-General is insistent upon a judgment
                                    of ouster. A suspensive judgment of ouster was entered in the Insurance Cases and without careful thought a like
                                    judgment might be suggested in these cases. Unlike the case of the Insurance Companies, Swift & Company and
                                    Hammond Packing Company have extensive packing house plants at St. Joseph, and any kind of judgment of
                                    ouster would absolutely prevent the use of the property if section 8972, of the Revised Statutes 1899, be valid, or at
                                    least create such a cloud on the title as to render difficult any future sale of the property. (5) Even if a [***11]
                                    judgment of ouster should go, it should be limited to ousting respondents from the particular illegal act charged, i.
                                    173 Mo. 356, *356; 73 S.W. 645, **645; 1903 Mo. LEXIS 257, ***6
                                    
                                    
                                    e., from fixing or maintaining prices to local butchers on the sale of fresh meats from the coolers at St. Joseph and
                                    St. Louis. The respondents have large and extensive packing houses; they buy millions of dollars of live stock in
                                    this State and ship their products to all portions of the State. These acts are separate and distinct from the mere
                                    sale of fresh meats to local butchers from local coolers, which was an infinitesimal part of respondents' business.
                                    Therefore, a judgment should go no further than to declare ""respondents are ousted from the alleged right or
                                    privilege of being parties to any combination to fix and maintain the prices on fresh meats sold from the coolers at
                                    St. Joseph and St. Louis to the local butchers in those cities."" Such is the extent of the offense or illegal right
                                    exercised. There is no doubt of the right to render a restricted judgment of ouster. This was decided in State ex inf.
                                    v. Lincoln Trust Co., 144 Mo. 599, where the court refused to enter a general ouster because of illegal acts but
                                    restricted the judgment to one of ouster against [***12]  the particular illegal acts. So it has elsewhere been
                                    decided. State ex rel. v. Portland Natural Gas & Oil Co., 153 Ind. 483; s. c., 53 N. E. 1092; State ex rel. v. Railroad,
                                    47 Oh. St. 130; s. c., 23 N. E. 928; State ex rel. v. Standard Oil Co., 49 Oh. St. 137; s. c., 30 N. E. 291. Such a
                                    course was pursued in Yore v. Superior Court, 108 Cal. 431; s. c., 41 Pac. 477; State v. Turnpike Co., 10 Conn.
                                    167; State v. Topeka, 30 Kan. 653; s. c., 2 Pac. 592; State v. Regents, 55 Kan. 389; s. c., 40 Pac. 656; People v.
                                    Railroad, 15 Wend. (N. Y.) 113; Com. v. Canal Co., 43 Pa. St. 301. These cases only apply the well-settled rule that
                                    in quo warranto the character of judgment rests entirely within the discretion of the court. State v. Bernoudy, 36 Mo.
                                    281; Weston v. Lane, 40 Kan. 479; s. c., 20 Pac. 260; 5 Thompson on Corporations, sec. 6812. So it was decided
                                    in State ex rel. v. Omaha & Council Bluffs Ry. & Bridge Co., 91 Iowa 517; s. c., 60 N. W. 126, a case against a
                                    foreign corporation failing to take out a license, and where the judgment was of ouster unless defendant should
                                    within sixty days qualify under the foreign corporation act. (6) No judgment of ouster should be entered. (a)
                                    A [***13]  general judgment of ouster would be unequal and unfair to Swift & Company and Hammond Packing
                                    Company. These companies have large packing houses at St. Joseph. A general judgment of ouster prevents the
                                    future use of this property (R. S. 1899, sec. 8972) by respondents or their assigns. Nelson Morris & Company have
                                    a like plant at St. Joseph. It is a copartnership, and can not be ousted, and yet it was found to be a party to the
                                    combination. Hence, for the same offense, Swift and Hammond lose their property and their right to do business,
                                    leaving their rival with its property and master of the St. Joseph business, and thus the court, by a stroke of the pen,
                                    creates an absolute monopoly. Armour Packing Company and Cudahy Packing Company have plants in Kansas
                                    City, almost adjoining the State line. They can cease doing business in this State but they still have their packing
                                    houses and can continue to serve the public elsewhere. They are found to have been in the same combination with
                                    Swift and Hammond, yet the latter must close and lose their packing houses while their lucky conspirators save
                                    theirs. It is, therefore, manifest that a general judgment of ouster would operate unequally,  [***14]  imposing upon
                                    those found equally guilty unequal penalties. (b) The following are other packers dealing in fresh meats at St.
                                    Joseph: Morton Gregson & Company, of Nebraska City, Nebraska; Wolff Packing Company, of Topeka, Kansas;
                                    Thudium Company, of Leavenworth, Kansas; and Morrell & Company, of Ottumwa, Iowa. These packers sold at the
                                    same prices as respondents, including the Krug Packing Company. No effort was made to charge or prove a case
                                    against any of them, though manifestly, if there was a combination, they, in maintaining the same prices, were privy
                                    to it. (c) The beef packers in St. Louis are Armour Packing Company, Swift & Company, Nelson Morris & Company,
                                    Cudahy Packing Company, St. Louis Dressed Beef Company, Thomas Stringer, Missouri Packing Company, Union
                                    Stock Yards Company, Prendeville & Brother, Steitz & Company, John Ball and William Tamme, and the evidence
                                    is about as strong against some of these packers as it is against any of the respondents, including that objected to
                                    as hearsay. No prosecution was instituted against any of them. (d) At the St. Louis coolers the following are
                                    engaged in pork packing and were in the alleged combination as to fresh pork: Philip [***15]  Keim, Henry Sartorius,
                                    John H. Belz & Company, Louis Gruensfelder, Krey Packing Company, Wissmath & Sons, Charles Heil, D. W.
                                    Grant and Laux & Son. Of these Laux & Son, Krey Packing Company, Wissmath & Sons, Charles P. Heil and Louis
                                    Gruensfelder openly concede that they were in combination held to be unlawful. No effort is made to prosecute
                                    them, though confessedly guilty, and even if it be claimed that they turned State's evidence, and therefore are freed
                                    from punishment, it is enough not to punish any of these concerns, and the State ought not to reward them by
                                    ousting respondents so as to permit them to do all the business without competition. As to the Krug Packing
                                    Company, the report states that no effort was made to press the case against it. (e) At St. Joseph the butchers say
                                    that, although they got great concessions in prices, they never gave any benefit thereof to any customer. (f) These
                                    same butchers at St. Joseph, Missouri, were in a union or voluntary organization for the purpose of fixing and
                                    maintaining prices to the consumers of meat as harmful to the public as anything claimed against respondents.

                                    the Act of 1903 of the Texas Legislature, commonly known as the antitrust statute, the contract between the
                                    defendant railway company and the Pullman Company was a valid and binding contract, not against public policy,
                                    and not at all in restraint of trade or commerce.  The Express Cases, 117 U.S., 1; The Pullman Cases, 139 U.S.,

                                    111.
                                    The contract between the Pullman Company and the railway company is not in conflict with the Act of 1903, and the
                                    making or carrying out of said contract would not violate any of the provisions of said law.
                                    The agreement between the Pullman Company and the railway company does not create a trust, a monopoly nor a
                                    conspiracy in restraint of trade as prohibited by the Act of 1903.
                                    In order for a trust to be created under the Act of 1903 there must be a combination of capital, skill or acts,
                                    and [***4]  the contract between the defendant companies does not create a combination.  A combination is a
                                    union, -- a joining of two or more factors into one result; a blending by which the original separate identity is merged
                                    into a result in which each of the original factors or parties have a common and not a separate interest.  A contract
                                    may create a combination if it brings about a union of interest, but if it does not, and if each party is contracting at
                                    arm's length and seeking to secure the best results, and if after the contract is made the interest of each party in the
                                    performance of the contract is separate, no combination will be created and no trust formed.
                                    A monopoly under the Act of 1903 is a combination or consolidation of two or more corporations so as to bring them
                                    under the same control and create a trust as defined in said Act, or when one corporation acquires control of the
                                    stock of another so as to lessen or destroy competition.
                                    A conspiracy in restraint of trade, under said Act of 1903, results when parties engaged in buying and selling agree
                                    to refuse to buy or sell to some other person, or when they boycott some other person.
                                    Before any contract will create a [***5]  trust, it must be mutual and obligate each party thereto to grant to the other
                                    party rights that are exclusive.  If the Pullman Company had obligated itself not to furnish cars to any other railway
                                    company and the railway company had bound itself to lease cars from no other company than the Pullman

                                    Company, the contract might be injurious to the public and unreasonable; but, in the absence of such mutual
                                    covenants, the obligation is unilateral and fails to create any combination.
                                    It is not contended that the railway company can not lawfully lease cars from the Pullman Company.  If, by reason
                                    of the Act of 1903, the exclusive feature of the contract became unlawful, the contract will be treated as divisible,
                                    and those provisions thereof which are not in conflict with the law will be binding, and those in conflict will be held to
                                    have been annulled.  Queen Ins. Co. v. State, 86 Texas, 250; Gates v. Hooper, 90 Texas, 563; State v. Shipper's

                                    a violation of the [***6]  antitrust law of 1903, because the Pullman Co. was not a competitor of the R. R. Co. and

                                    The contract in question is not a ""combination"" as defined in the acts of 1903 and the petition therefore fails to state
                                    the violation of the terms of that statute.

                                    The [***7]  allegations of plaintiff's second amended petition were sufficient to bring the case within the scope of the
                                    Act of 1903, and the proof was ample to sustain the judgment rendered by the court under said act.  Plaintiff's
                                    cause of action was complete upon such pleading and proof and it was not incumbent upon plaintiff to show
                                    specifically that the exclusive provisions of the contract complained of had been enforced by showing that there
                                    were other competing sleeping car companies, or that other sleeping car companies applied to the railroad
                                    company to be allowed to furnish sleeping cars to it, nor is it any excuse to say that the contract did not bind the
                                    Pullman Company not to lease sleeping cars to other railroads.  Bill of Rights, State of Texas, sec. 26; City of

                                    1. One who suffers injury by reason of a conspiracy formed for the purpose of preventing competition in trade in
                                    commodities in common use, which combinations are declared illegal by statute, has a right of action to recover
                                    damages sustained. 8 Cyc. of Law, p. 651; Rourke v. Elk Drug Co., 77 N. Y. Supp., 373; 75 N. Y. App. Div., 145;

                                    2. The judge is not authorized to direct verdict for the defendants if the plaintiff has introduced any evidence tending
                                    to sustain the material allegations of his petition. Newberger & Sons v. Heintze & Co., 3 Texas Civ. App., 261; Ney

                                    1. The court did not err in giving peremptory instruction for the defendant, because there was no evidence to
                                    support any of the material allegations in plaintiff's petition. Delz v. Winfree, 80 Texas, 403, 25 S. W. Rep., 50; Olive

                                    2. An individual can not recover damages on account of a conspiracy unless the facts alleged and proved
                                    constituted damages to him personally, independent of the alleged conspiracy. A person or corporation has an
                                    absolute right to refuse to have business relations with any person whomsoever, for any cause, and the law does
                                    not force any one to sell to another. Delz v. Winfree, 80 Texas, 403; Grand Lodge v. Schuetze, 83 S. W. Rep., 241;
                                    Hunt v. Simonds, 19 Mo., 583, 586; Cooley on Torts (2d ed.), secs. 124-126, 278, 690; Bishop on Non-contract

                                    3. It was the duty of the court to instruct a verdict for appellee, because the testimony [**3]  adduced at the trial of
                                    the case did not, in legal contemplation, amount to ""any evidence,"" and ""it is the duty of the court to instruct a
                                    verdict, though there be slight testimony, if its probative force be so weak that it only raises a mere surmise of
                                    suspicion of the existence of the fact sought to be established. Joske v. Irvine, 91 Texas, 582; Improvement & Ry.

                                    Acts in question were intended to prohibit combination generally, which restrain trade, or suppress competition, but
                                    not those contracts within the purview of the Railroad Commission law.  The Commission under that law has
                                    exclusive power and is charged with the exclusive duty to protect the public against unjust or excessive rates on the
                                    part of railway and express companies, and hence the contract in question is not within the meaning of the antitrust
                                    laws.  Thorpe v. Adams, L. R., 6 C. P., 135; Moore v. Bell, 95 Texas, 157; Rev. Stat., arts. 4561-4584; San Diego

                                    The contract in question was entered into before the Antitrust Act of 1903 and plaintiff's petition does not allege that
                                    the exclusive feature of the contract was carried out in such a way after that Act became effective, as to violate the
                                    terms of the Act.  We submit that the allegations are insufficient to show a violation of the law, if it applied to the
                                    contract in question.  See also United States v. Dietrich, 126 [***6]  Fed. Rep., 671; Oregon Co. v. Windsor, 20

                                    Brewster v. Kitchell, 1 Salk, 198.  The petition should allege an intentional violation of the law.  State v. Compress

                                    The contract in question was not a violation of either the Antitrust Acts of 1899 or of 1903, because the express
                                    company was not a competitor of the railway company, and the railway company in giving the express company the
                                    exclusive privilege of transporting express matter over its lines merely operated a part of its own business through
                                    an instrumentality which it had the right to select.  Northern Securities Case, 193 U.S., 197; Welch v. Phelps & B.

                                    The contract in question is not a ""combination"" as defined in the Act of 1903, and the petition therefore fails to state
                                    a violation of the terms of that Act.

                                    In Addyston Pipe Co. case, 85 Fed. Rep., 271, the rule is stated to be ""where the main and controlling purpose of
                                    the contract is a lawful purpose and the restriction of competition is merely collateral or incidental to the main
                                    purpose, such incidental and contingent restraint of trade is not within the purpose of the statute.""
                                    In United States v. E. C. Knight, 156 U.S., 1, it was decided that ""the fact that trade or commerce might be indirectly
                                    affected, was not enough to entitle complainant to a decree."" To same effect is United States v. Traffic Association,
                                    171 U.S., 505.
                                    In the express cases, 117 U.S., page 1, and the Pullman Palace car cases, 139 U.S., 89, the Federal Supreme
                                    Court holds that the contract between the railroad company and an express company or a sleeping car company,
                                    whereby the latter acquire exclusive [***8]  rights on the lines of railroads is not monopolistic in its character nor
                                    opposed to public policy.  These utterances by the highest federal court fully establish the proposition that the
                                    contract in question looked at from the most extreme standpoint, was only a partial restriction in competition, and
                                    was not unreasonable at common law or contrary to public policy.  If it was not so at common law then it was not
                                    so, if our argument holds good, under the language of the Antitrust Act of 1903.  United States v. Freight
                                    Association, 166 U.S., 341; Hopkins v. United States, 171 U.S., 578; United States v. Workman's A. Council, 26 L.
                                    R. A., 158; Addyston P. & S. Co. v. United States, 175 U.S., 211, and 95 Texas, 603; Addyston Pipe Co. case, 85
                                    Fed. Rep., 271; 175 U.S., 211.
                                    We think the case is distinguishable from the cases heretofore held to violate the antitrust law, and within the
                                    doctrine announced in Gates v. Hooper, 90 Texas, 563. Vanderweghe v. American Brewing Co., 61 S. W. Rep.,
                                    526. See also White Dental Co. v. Hertzberg, 51 S. W. Rep., 355.
                                    The contract in question is not an unreasonable restriction in trade or upon competition and is not illegal because
                                    the Antitrust [***9]  Act of 1903 applies only to unreasonable restraints in trade and substantial restrictions in
                                    competition.
                                    If the Antitrust Act of 1903 prohibits reasonable restrictions in trade and competition in the manufacture, making,
                                    transportation, sale or purchase of merchandise, produce or commodities, then it is void because it deprives the
                                    prohibited persons from exercising the constitutional right of making contracts.  Dobbins v. City of Los Angeles, 195
                                    U.S. Rep., 223; Lawton v. Steele, 152 U.S., 133; Express cases, 117 U.S., 1; Pullman cases, 139 U.S., 89.
                                    If the Act of 1903 prohibits reasonable restrictions upon trade and competition, then the statute takes away the
                                    appellees' liberty and property without due process of law, and it is an impairment of rights protected by the
                                    fourteenth amendment to the Federal Constitution.
                                    The contract in question appears from the plaintiff's petition to have been entered into before the passage of the
                                    Antitrust Act of 1903, and that Act is an ex post facto law and a law impairing the obligations of the contract within
                                    the meaning of the United States Constitution as regards their contract.  Express cases, 117 U.S., 1; Pullman
                                    cases, 139 U.S.,  [***10]  89.
                                    The Antitrust Act of 1903, the violation of which is complained of, is contrary to the fourteenth amendment to the
                                    Federal Constitution and denies the appellees the equal protection of the law, because in the 17th section of the
                                    Act, it provides that nothing in the act shall be construed to destroy any rights of the state to recover penalties or
                                    forfeit charters of domestic corporations, or prohibit foreign corporations from doing business in the state for acts
                                    committed before the Act takes effect, but does not provide for the recovery of penalties either against an individual
                                    or a foreign corporation for acts committed before the Act takes effect.  Connolly v. Union Pipe Line Co., 184 U.S.,

                                    The anti-trust Act of May 25, 1899, was repealed by the anti-trust Act of March 31, 1903. Section 35, article 3,

                                    No right was reserved to the State by said Act of March 31, 1903, to recover penalties against foreign corporations
                                    for violations of said Act of May 25, 1899, or any other law upon said subject. Act May 25, 1899, supra; Act March

                                    This suit, though civil in form, is a prosecution against the defendant to recover penalties for an offense, the
                                    plaintiff's cause of action is criminal in [***2]  its character, and the bar of limitation of two years prescribed by article
                                    219 of the Code of Criminal Procedure precludes a recovery by the plaintiff of any penalties against the defendant
                                    under such anti-trust Act of May 25, 1899. Article 219, Code Criminal Procedure; Missouri, K. & T. Ry. Co. v. State,

                                    It appears from the face of the plaintiff's petition that the plaintiff's cause of action, if any it ever had, to recover
                                    penalties under the anti-trust Act of May 25, 1899, accrued more than two years before the institution of this suit
                                    and therefore if the plaintiff's cause of action is not to be regarded as criminal in its nature, and not governed by
                                    article 219 [***3]  of the Code of Criminal Procedure, such cause of action must be treated as civil in its character,
                                    and having accrued more than two years before the institution of this suit, it is barred by the statute of limitation of
                                    two years, as prescribed in article 3354 of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas. Revised Civil Statutes, art. 3354;

                                    Plaintiff's cause of action, if not regarded as criminal in its nature, is civil in its character, so much thereof as
                                    accrued prior to the 22d day of September, 1902, is barred by the statute of limitation of four years as prescribed in
                                    article 3358 of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas. Revised Civil Statutes, art. 3358; Boswell v. Robinson, 33 N. J.
                                    Law, 273, and also same as above.
                                    Any violator of said Act is guilty of a felony, and as to such violator the period of limitation for the commission of the
                                    felony is three years as prescribed by article 218 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the State of Texas, and
                                    therefore a person [***4]  prosecuted by an action, civil in form, for the recovery of the penalty of $ 50 per day for
                                    violating said Act is, if no other period of limitation is available to him, entitled to the protection of the statute of
                                    limitation of three years prescribed by said article 218 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by analogy. Pomeroy's

                                    Section 2 of the anti-trust Act of May 25, 1899, does not sufficiently designate an offense against the laws within the
                                    requirement of article 3 of the general provisions of the Penal Code of the State of Texas, which declares that no
                                    person shall be punished for any act or omission unless the same is made a penal offense and a penalty is affixed
                                    thereto by the written law of this State; nor within the requirement of article 6 of the general provisions of the Penal
                                    Code of the State of Texas, which prescribes that whenever it appears that a provision of the penal law was
                                    indefinitely framed or of such doubtful construction that it can not be understood, either from the language in which
                                    it is expressed or from some other written law of the State, such penal law shall be regarded as wholly inoperative;
                                    [***5]  nor within the requirement of article 9 of the general provisions of the Penal Code of the State of Texas,
                                    which prescribes that no person shall be punished for an offense not made penal by the plain import of the words of
                                    the law.
                                    Section 6 of the anti-trust Act of May 25, 1899, does not sufficiently define an offense within the requirement of
                                    article 3 of the general provisions of the Penal Code of the State of Texas, which declares that no person shall be
                                    punished for any act or omission unless the same is made a penal offense and a penalty is affixed thereto by the
                                    written law of this State; nor does it sufficiently define an offense within the requirement of article 6 of the general
                                    provisions of the Penal Code of the State of Texas; nor does it sufficiently define an offense within the requirement

                                    The verdict of the jury in assessing penalties against the defendant at the sum of $ 1,549,500 for alleged violations
                                    of law, for each of the days between May 31, 1900, and March 31, 1903, was so grossly and shockingly excessive
                                    as to show passion and prejudice on the part of the jury against the defendant. Constitution of Texas, art. 1, sec.

                                    The action of the court in overruling appellant's motion for a new trial, and its refusal to set aside the verdict of the
                                    jury, and in entering judgment upon the verdict against appellant,  [***7]  results in depriving appellant of its property
                                    without due process of law, in violation of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United

                                    The court erred in overruling defendant's general exception to the motion or application of the State for the

                                    The anti-trust Act of March 31,  [***8]  1903, expressly preserves all the rights of the State to recover penalties, to
                                    forfeit charters and prohibit foreign corporations from doing business in the State, and the cause of action asserted
                                    in this cause is not affected by the repeal of the Act of 1899. Anti-trust law, May 25, 1899, General Laws of Texas,

                                    The Acts of 1899 and 1903, being valid acts, the court did not err in overruling the several special exceptions. State

                                    The anti-trust law of 1903 did not ameliorate the penalty provided for violations of the Act of 1899. Wall v. State, 18

                                    As applied to the facts in this case, a ""trust"" is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more persons, to
                                    create or carry out restriction in trade; to prevent or lessen competition in the sale or purchase of merchandise,
                                    produce or commodities, and any contract or agreement creating such combination is absolutely void, and not
                                    enforcible in law or equity. Ch. 94, sec. 1, p. 119, Acts of the Twenty-eighth Legislature, 1903; Texas & Pac. Coal

                                    No principle is more firmly established than that remote and speculative damages can not be recovered on account

                                    A contract by two or more persons, firms or corporations combining their capital, skill or acts, to create or carry out

                                    A contract which, if entered into within the State of Texas, and to be performed in the State of Texas is in violation
                                    of the anti-trust laws of Texas, though in fact entered into in another State, but to be performed and in fact carried

                                    The entire transaction, as is affirmatively disclosed by the pleadings of appellant, constituted interstate commerce,

                                    appellants:
                                    The acquisition in 1899 by the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey of the stocks of the other companies was not a
                                    combination of independent enterprises.  [****8]  All of the companies had the same stockholders who in the
                                    various corporate organizations were carrying on parts of the one business.  The business as a whole belonged to
                                    this body of common stockholders who, commencing prior to 1870, had as its common owners gradually built it up
                                    and developed it.  The properties used in the business, in so far as they had been acquired by purchase, were
                                    purchased from time to time with the common funds for account of the common owners.  For the most part the
                                    plants and properties used in the business in 1899 had not been acquired by purchase but were the creation of the
                                    common owners.  The majority of the companies, and the most important ones, had been created by the common
                                    owners for the convenient conduct of branches of the business.  The stocks of these companies had always been
                                    held in common ownership.  The business of the companies and their relations to each other were unchanged by
                                    the transfer of the stocks of the other companies to the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey.
                                    The Sherman Act has no application to the transfer to, or acquisition by, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey
                                    of the stocks of the various manufacturing and producing [****9]  corporations, for the reason that such transfer and
                                    acquisition were not acts of interstate or foreign commerce, nor direct and immediate in their effect on interstate and

                                    foreign commerce, nor within the power of Congress to regulate interstate and foreign commerce.  United States v.
                                    Knight, 156 U.S. 1; In re Greene, 52 Fed. Rep. 104.
                                    The contracts, combinations and conspiracies of § 1 of the Sherman Act are contracts and combinations which
                                    contractually restrict the freedom of one or more of the parties to them in the conduct of his or their trade, and
                                    combinations or conspiracies which restrict the freedom of others than the parties to them in the conduct of their
                                    business, when these restrictions directly affect interstate or foreign trade.  Purchases or acquisitions of property
                                    are not in any sense such contracts, combinations or conspiracies.  Contracts in restraint of trade are contracts with
                                    a stranger to the contractor's business, although in some cases carrying on a similar one, which wholly or partially
                                    restricts the freedom of the contractor in carrying on that business as otherwise he would.  Holmes, J., in Northern
                                    Securities Case, 193 U.S. 404; Pollock on Contracts,  [****10]  7th ed., p. 352.  Such contracts are invalid because
                                    of the injury to the public in being deprived of the restricted party's industry and the injury to the party himself by
                                    being precluded from pursuing his occupation.  Oregon Steam Navigation Co. v. Windsor, 20 Wall. 68; Alger v.
                                    Thacker, 19 Pick. 54. Combinations in restraint of trade are combinations between two or more persons whereby
                                    each party is restricted in his freedom in carrying on his business in his own way.  Hilton v. Eckersley, 6 El. & Bl. 47.
                                    The cases in which combinations have been held invalid at common law as being in restraint of trade deal with
                                    executory agreements between independent manufacturers and dealers whereby the freedom of each to conduct
                                    his business with respect to his own interest and judgment is restricted.  Morris Run Coal Co. v. Barclay Coal Co.,
                                    68 Pa. St. 173; Salt Co. v. Guthrie, 35 Oh. St. 666; Arnot v. Pittston and Elmira Coal Co., 68 N.Y. 558; Craft v.

                                    The cases in which trusts and [****11]  similar combinations have been held invalid as combinations in restraint of
                                    trade all deal with devices employed to secure the centralized control of separately owned concerns.  People v.
                                    North River Sugar Refining Co., 54 Hun, 354; S.C., 121 N.Y. 582; State v. Nebraska Distilling Co., 29 Nebraska,

                                    A conspiracy in restraint of trade is a combination of two or more to deprive others than its members of their
                                    freedom in conducting their business in their own way by acts having that effect.  A combination to boycott is a
                                    sufficient illustration.
                                    The Sherman Act did not enlarge the category of contracts, combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade.
                                    United States v. Trans-Missouri Association, 166 U.S. 290; United States v. Joint Traffic Association, 171 U.S. 505;

                                    involved combinations, either expressly by the terms of the agreements constituting them, restricting the freedom of
                                    each of the [****12]  members in the conduct of his or its business, or in the nature of conspiracies to restrict the
                                    freedom of others than their members in the conduct of their business.  The Northern Securities Case, 193 U.S.
                                    197, was a combination which, through the device adopted, restricted the freedom of the stockholders of two
                                    independent railroad companies in the separate and independent control and management of their respective

                                    Purchases and acquisitions of property do not restrain trade.  The freedom of a trader is not restricted by the sale of
                                    his property and business.  The elimination of competition, so far as his property and business is concerned, is not
                                    a restraint of trade, but is merely an incidental effect of the exercise of the fundamental civil right to buy and sell
                                    property freely.  The acquisition of property is not made illegal by the fact that the purchaser intends thereby to put
                                    an end to the use of such property in competition with him.  Every purchase of property necessarily involves the
                                    elimination of that property from use in competition with the purchaser and, therefore, implies an intent to effect
                                    such elimination.  Cincinnati Packet Co. v. Bay, 200 U.S. 179.
                                    [****13]  The transfer to, and acquisition by, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey of the stocks of the various

                                    confers is not, a combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade declared to be illegal by the first section of the
                                    Sherman Act.  Because of the common ownership of the different properties in interest they were not independent
                                    or competitive but they were the constituent elements of a single business organism.  This situation was not
                                    affected by the transfer to the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, who had the same body of stockholders and
                                    had controlled the separate companies and continued to control them through the Standard Oil Company of New
                                    Jersey.  These considerations differentiate the present case from the Northern Securities Case, 193 U.S. 197. The
                                    Northern Securities Case dealt with a combination of diverse owners of separate and diverse properties which were
                                    bound by the law of their being as quasi-public corporations invested with public franchises to continue separate,
                                    independent and competitive, creating through the instrumentality of the holding company [****14]  a common
                                    control which would necessarily prevent competitive relations.
                                    There is no warrant for the assumption that corporations engaged in the same business are naturally or potentially
                                    competitive regardless of their origin or ownership.  If the same body of men create several corporations to carry on
                                    a large business for the economical advantages of location or for any other reason, and the stocks of these
                                    corporations are all in common ownership, it is a fiction to say that they are potentially competitive or that their
                                    natural relation is one of competition.
                                    The common owners of the Standard Oil properties and business had the right to vest the properties and business
                                    in a single corporation, notwithstanding that such a transaction might tend to prevent the disintegration of the
                                    different properties into diverse ownerships.  The Sherman Act does not impose restrictions upon the rights of joint
                                    owners.
                                    The acquisitions prior to 1882 were lawful and their effect upon competition was incidental.  The purpose of the trust
                                    of 1879 was to bring the scattered legal titles to the joint properties then vested in various individuals into a single
                                    trusteeship.  The purpose of the Trust [****15]  Agreement of 1882 was to provide a practicable trusteeship to hold
                                    the legal title to the joint properties, an effective executive management and a marketable symbol or evidence of the
                                    interest of each owner.  The only question raised in the case of State v. Standard Oil Company, 49 Oh. St. 137, was
                                    whether it was Ultra vires for the Standard Oil Company of Ohio to permit its stock to be held by the trustees
                                    instead of by the real owners.  The method of distribution adopted on the dissolution of the trust was the only
                                    feasible plan of distribution.  Each certificate-holder was given an assignment of his proportionate interest in all the
                                    companies.  All being parts of the common business there was no basis for separate valuations.  The value of the
                                    interest of every owner was dependent upon its being kept together as an entirety.  The transaction of 1899 was
                                    practically an incorporation of the entire business by the common owners through the ownership of the Standard Oil
                                    Company of New Jersey.  That was the plain purpose, object and effect of the transaction.
                                    The first section of the Sherman Act deals directly with contracts, combinations and conspiracies in restraint of
                                    trade.  The [****16]  second section deals directly with monopolizing and attempts to monopolize.  Monopolizing
                                    does not enlarge the operation of the first section nor does its absence restrict the operation of that section.
                                    The first section deals with entities, a contract, combination, a conspiracy; and the entities themselves are expressly
                                    declared to be illegal, and may be annulled or destroyed.  The second section deals with acts.
                                    At common law monopoly had a precise definition.  Blackstone, Vol. 4, p. 160; Butchers' Union Co. v. Crescent City
                                    Co., 111 U.S. 756. Monopoly imports the idea of exclusiveness and an exclusiveness existing by reason of the
                                    restraint of the liberty of others.  With the commonlaw monopoly the restraint resulted from the grant of the
                                    exclusive right or privilege.  Under the Sherman Act there must be some substitute for the grant as a source of the
                                    exclusiveness and restraint essential to monopolizing.  The essential element is found in the statement of Judge
                                    Jackson ( In re Greene, 52 Fed. Rep. 116) that monopolizing is securing or acquiring ""the exclusive right in such
                                    trade or commerce by means which prevent or restrain others from engaging therein."" Exclusion by
                                    competition [****17]  is not monopolizing.  Pollock on Torts, 8th ed., p. 152; Mogul Case, L.R. 23 Q.B.D. 615; (1892)
                                    App. Cas. 51. Monopolizing within the act is the appropriation of a trade by means of contracts, combinations or
                                    conspiracies in restraint of trade or other unlawful or tortious acts, whereby ""the subject in general is restrained from
                                    that liberty of . . . trading which he had before."" In the absence of such means or agencies of exclusion, size,
                                    aggregated capital, power, and volume of business are not monopolizing in a legal sense.

                                    Swift v. United States, 196 U.S. 375, was the case of a combination of corporations, firms and individuals
                                    separately and independently engaged in the business, together controlling nearly the whole of it, to monopolize it
                                    by certain acts and course of conduct effective to that end when done and pursued by such a combination.

                                    Anderson v. Shawnee Compress Co., 209 U.S. 423, rest upon special grounds and are not applicable to this case.
                                    [****18]  See on the other hand, In re Greene, 52 Fed. Rep. 104, Jackson, J.; Trenton Potteries Co. v. Oliphant, 58

                                    The acquisition of existing plants or properties however extensive, though made to obtain their trade and eliminate
                                    their competition, is not a monopoly at common law or monopolizing under the Sherman Act, in the absence of the
                                    exclusion of others from the trade by conspiracies to that end or contracts in restraint of trade on an elaborate and
                                    effective scale, or other systematic, wrongful, tortious or illegal acts.  When such monopolizing is present the
                                    remedy of the act is to prohibit the offending conspiracies, contracts, and illegal acts or means of exclusion, leaving
                                    the individual or corporation to pursue his or its business with the properties and plants that have been acquired or
                                    created shorn of the monopolizing elements in the conduct of the business.
                                    The acquisition of competing plants and properties cannot be rendered unlawful by imputing to [****19]  such
                                    acquisitions an intent to monopolize.  The acquisition of plants and properties does not exclude anyone from the
                                    trade and therefore the intent to monopolize cannot be attributed to such acquisitions.  The proposition that an
                                    acquisition of property is rendered invalid because of a collateral intent to monopolize is not sustained by the
                                    authorities relied upon to support it.  Addyston Pipe Case, 85 Fed. Rep. 291, and cases there cited.  The substantial
                                    acquisitions made by the owners of the Standard Oil business antedated the Sherman Act and they resulted from
                                    separate transactions extending over a long period of years.  They were in all cases accretions to an existing
                                    business.  They formed an insignificant part of the business as it now exists.  The Sherman Act is intended to
                                    prevent present monopolizing or attempts to monopolize.  Whether acquisitions made many years ago were or
                                    were not associated with an attempt to monopolize has no relation with the present attempt at monopolizing.
                                    The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey was not monopolizing, or attempting to monopolize, or combining with
                                    anyone else to monopolize, interstate and foreign trade in petroleum and its products [****20]  when this proceeding
                                    was instituted, or at any time.
                                    The ownership of the pipe lines has not been a means of monopolizing.  Substantially all of the pipe lines owned by
                                    the Standard Oil companies have been constructed by those companies.  There has never been any exclusion of
                                    anyone from the oil fields either in the production of oil, or its purchase, or its storage, or its gathering or
                                    transportation by pipe lines.  Ownership of the pipe lines does not give the Standard companies any advantages in
                                    dealing with the producers which are not open to others.
                                    The decree erroneously includes and operates upon several of the appellant companies.
                                    The sixth section of the decree is unwarranted and impracticable in various of its provisions.
                                    It was error to deny the motion of the appellants to vacate the order permitting service upon them outside of the
                                    Eastern Division of the Eastern District of Missouri, and to set aside the service upon them of the writs of subpoena
                                    issued thereunder; and error to overrule the pleas of the appellants to the jurisdiction of the court over them.  The
                                    appellants were not residents of the Eastern District of Missouri nor were they found therein when the [****21]
                                    order was made authorizing the service of process upon them outside of the district.  There was no proceeding
                                    pending in that district involving a controversy for the determination of which the appellants were necessary parties.
                                    Mr. D. T. Watson, also for appellants:

                                    The transfer in 1899 to the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey of the various non-competitive properties jointly
                                    used by them as one property was not a restriction of interstate trade, or an attempt to monopolize, or a violation of
                                    the Sherman Act.
                                    The Sherman Act permits trusts, combines, corporations and individuals to enter into and compete for interstate
                                    trade so long as they act lawfully.  It does not seek to regulate the methods nor forbid those who enter into trade
                                    from doing their business in the form of a trust, corporation or combine, provided they carry it on lawfully.
                                    The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey after 1899 might legitimately and properly compete for interstate trade,
                                    notwithstanding the combination [****22]  of the group of properties gave it a great power, only provided it did not
                                    restrain such trade or by unlawful means seek to gain a monopoly contrary to the provisions of the Sherman Act.
                                    There is nothing in this case to show that after 1899 the combination did unlawfully compete, restrict or seek to
                                    monopolize interstate trade; yet such evidence was indispensable to prove that the combination was violating the
                                    Sherman Act in 1906.See the Calumet & Hecla Case, Judge Kanappen, 167 Fed. Rep. 709, 715; Judge Lurton,
                                    167 Fed. Rep. 727, 728; Judge Gray in United States v. Reading Co., decided December 8, 1910.
                                    There is a great difference between the Northern Securities Case and the case at bar.
                                    On the question of potential competition, the idea of competition between properties all owned by the same persons
                                    is a novelty.  The idea that properties themselves compete, and that if one man owns two or more he must compete
                                    with himself, is startling.  Competition between joint owners is also novel.  Fairbanks v. Leary, 40 Wisconsin, 642,
                                    643; Whitwell v. Continental Tobacco Co., 125 Fed. Rep. 454.
                                    Competition is the striving of two or more persons, or corporations, either individually [****23]  or jointly, for one
                                    thing, i.e., trade; it is personal action; the strife between different persons.  Properties do not compete.  Their
                                    relative locations may more readily enable their owners to use them in competition, but of themselves and as
                                    against each other, they do not compete.
                                    This idea makes the Sherman Act read that the same person or group of individuals shall not own and operate two
                                    or more sites for refineries or for stores or for any kind of manufactories which might be used by different owners in
                                    competition.  Joint Traffic Association Case, 171 U.S. 505, 567.
                                    The words ""potential"" or ""naturally competitive"" are not in the Sherman Act.  Cascade Railroad Co. v. Superior
                                    Court, 51 Washington, 346. The rule of potential competition refers only to the ownership of the physical properties
                                    which produce the oil which goes into interstate commerce, and not to the oil itself.  United States v. E.C. Knight
                                    Co., 156 U.S. 1; Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U.S. 407.
                                    The Sherman Act is a highly penal one.  In a criminal prosecution under the act the degree of proof is beyond a
                                    reasonable doubt.  In a civil suit under it, the degree is not so great, but the proof [****24]  must be direct, plain and
                                    convincing.  United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Assn., 58 Fed. Rep. 77; Northern Securities Co. v. United
                                    States, 193 U.S. 197, 401; State v. Continental Tobacco Co., 177 Mississippi, 1.
                                    There is a distinction between private traders and railroad companies; and see also distinction under Sherman Act
                                    between quasi-public corporations and private traders.  Trans-Missouri Case, 166 U.S. 290.
                                    The mere method in which stocks are held is not prescribed by the Sherman Act; all methods are lawful if not used
                                    to restrict trade or gain an unlawful monopoly.  Under the court's ruling the effectiveness of a large business
                                    organization may, by reason of that very fact, bring it under the Sherman Act.
                                    The decree below was not justified by the facts found by the court; or by the Sherman Act; after the court in § 5
                                    permitted the distribution among the shareholders of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey of the stocks held by
                                    that company, it did without lawful authority so to do, define and limit the method of that distribution; restrict the
                                    distributees in the future sale, use and disposal of their stocks; restrict the distributees in the sale, use and
                                    disposal [****25]  of their properties; and in the contract relations thereafter to exist, as well as the use and
                                    disposition of the different properties in such a drastic manner as to greatly injure and destroy the value of the same
                                    221 U.S. 1, *1; 31 S. Ct. 502, **502; 55 L. Ed. 619, ***619; 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1725, ****21
                                    
                                    
                                    and render their future profitable use practically impossible.  The decree disintegrates properties built with
                                    appellants' moneys for joint use so as to create units that never before existed and compels these units separately
                                    to carry on business and compete with other units, directly contrary to the purpose of their creation.  It allows the
                                    future operation and use of the refineries, pipe lines, and other properties of the appellants only under the vague
                                    and indefinite, but broad and comprehensive, terms of § 6 of the decree, by subjecting those who in the future
                                    operate them to attachment for contempt for unwittingly violating vague and indefinite terms.  It prohibits appellants
                                    from engaging in all interstate commerce until the discontinuance of the operation of the illegal combination, thus
                                    inflicting a new penalty for an indefinite and uncertain period.
                                    All of such restrictions are unauthorized by the Sherman Act, are in violation of the settled rules governing [****26]
                                    injunctions, and are contrary to the provisions of the different decrees heretofore approved by this court under the
                                    Sherman Act, and especially the one in the Northern Securities Case.
                                    The decree authorized by the Sherman Act is wholly negative, and one that merely enjoins -- stops an illegal thing
                                    in operation when the petition is filed or which then is foreseen.  Lacassagne v. Chapius, 144 U.S. 124; E.C. Knight

                                    The Sherman Act prescribes certain specific methods of relief which are exclusive of all others.  Noyes on

                                    The decree hampers and greatly injures the value of the stock of the stockholders,  [****27]  though they are not
                                    parties to the bill.
                                    A corporation, when party to a bill in equity, does represent its stockholders, but only within the scope of corporate
                                    power, and not as to the individual rights of the stockholder to do with his property as he chooses.  Taylor & Co. v.
                                    Southern Pacific Co., 122 Fed. Rep. 147, 153, 154. A corporation has no right to conclude or affect the right of any
                                    shareholder in respect of the ownership or incidents of his particular shares.  Brown v. Pacific Mail Steamship Co.,

                                    The decree follows the appellants and their properties after the dissolution.
                                    The Sherman Act closely limits and defines the power of the court on a petition filed to give equitable relief.  The
                                    petition must pray that such violations shall be enjoined or otherwise prohibited; and it is these violations of the act
                                    that the court may now enjoin, and only such violations.  Past unlawful competition does not deprive parties of their
                                    right to conduct lawful competition.  New Haven R.R. Case, 200 U.S. 361, 404.
                                    The Sherman Act does not [****28]  give power to the courts to strike down and disintegrate a non-competing group
                                    of physical properties used to manufacture an article of trade.  These physical properties are bought and held and
                                    used under state laws; they do not enter into interstate commerce and hence are not under Federal control.  New
                                    Haven R.R. Co. v. Interstate Com. Comm., 200 U.S. 361, 404; State v. Omaha Elevator Co., 75 Nebraska, 637.
                                    The effect of the decree is ruinous.  For instance, these companies jointly own 54,616 miles of pipe lines, of which
                                    the seven individual defendants and their associates built over 50,000 miles, in which they have an investment of
                                    over $61,000,000.
                                    The decree splits up this pipe line system into eleven parts, takes away from the owners, who jointly built the pipe
                                    lines and who created the sub-companies, all control over the different sub-companies, and compels the eleven
                                    different parts to stand alone, independently of their principal and of each other, to be hostile to and to compete with
                                    their principal and with one another.
                                    221 U.S. 1, *1; 31 S. Ct. 502, **502; 55 L. Ed. 619, ***619; 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1725, ****25
                                    
                                    
                                    Pipe lines are never parallel but always continuous, and each line has a value which depends wholly upon its
                                    connection with other parts of the system,  [****29]  and whether all are used together as one whole.  The carrying
                                    out of the decree would cut the pipe line system into isolated segments, prevent such use, and make the successful
                                    operation of the pipe lines impossible.
                                    The decree would especially destroy the value of the stock of all shareholders who each had five shares or less.
                                    The stockholders on August 19, 1907, holding from one to four shares each numbered 1,157, and the stockholders
                                    owning five shares each numbered 439, out of a total number of 5,085 stockholders.
                                    Considering the case de novo, and not on the findings of the court below, it is not true that when the petition in this
                                    case was filed in 1906, the seven individual appellants and their associates, private traders in oil, were, contrary to
                                    the provisions of the Sherman Act, carrying on a conspiracy to restrain interstate and foreign trade in oils, and to
                                    gain by illegal means a monopoly thereof.
                                    The Federal law allowed and allows each of the individuals to compete freely for the interstate and foreign traffic in
                                    oil and its products.  He may use all the weapons that his ingenuity and skill can suggest, to wage a successful
                                    warfare.  His rights to compete are not [****30]  limited to merely such means as are fair or reasonable, but are only
                                    limited to such as are unlawful and directly tend to the violation of the Sherman Act.  The Federal law also allows
                                    and assures to each competitor whatever share, however large, of the interstate or foreign trade in oil he or they
                                    may win provided his means are not unlawful.  The Sherman Act was passed to protect trade and further
                                    competition.  It makes such restraint and monopoly a crime and inflicts, on conviction, severe penalties for such
                                    offense.  It permits one set of competitors to purchase the property of other competitors solely to avoid further
                                    competition.  The mere size of the competing corporations or combinations is immaterial.
                                    The monopoly of a trade at common law was forbidden because, and only because, it excluded all others from
                                    practicing such trade, and seems to have been then limited to a royal grant, as, for example, giving the exclusive
                                    right to manufacture playing cards.  It was and is a distinct thing from engrossing, regrating or forestalling the
                                    market, all of which were based on the prevention of artificial prices for the necessaries of life.  No one of these falls
                                    under Federal jurisdiction,  [****31]  but each is subject to state control only.
                                    The present litigation is between the Federal Government and certain of its citizens.The questions involved are
                                    solely the rights of these Federal citizens and the effect upon those rights of the Sherman Act, and whether these
                                    Federal citizens have violated the provisions of that act.
                                    There was and is no such thing as a Federal crime, aside from express congressional acts, and as no such act was
                                    in existence prior to 1890, as to the matters charged in the petition, all the matters and things done by the
                                    defendants prior thereto are immaterial.
                                    This case involves, and only involves, the question of the restraint and monopolization of interstate and foreign
                                    trade in oil in November, 1906, when the petition was filed; it does not involve any alleged restraint or monopoly of
                                    the oil industry in any of the States.
                                    The appellants were lawfully entitled to so hold and use in interstate trade all of its combined properties.
                                    To succeed in this case, the Government must also show that the said Standard Oil Company was then in 1906
                                    using its power to actually restrain interstate or foreign trade in oil, or was then in 1906 excluding or
                                    attempting [****32]  to exclude by illegal means others from said trade and attempting to monopolize the same, or a
                                    part thereof.
                                    The Sherman Act does not compel private traders, however organized, to compete with each other.  The character
                                    of the oil business was and is such that a great corporation was and is an economic necessity for carrying on that
                                    industry.  The growth and success of the Standard Oil Company was the result of individual enterprise and the
                                    natural laws of trade.  It was not the result of unlawful means, but of skill, unremitting toil, denials and hardships,
                                    and is an instance of where the continuous use for forty years of skill, labor and capital reached a great success.
                                    To prove a violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act the Government must clearly show that when the petition was filed
                                    appellants were then actually restraining interstate trade in oil.

                                    To prove a monopoly under § 2 of the Sherman Act, the Government must show that the appellants were, when the
                                    petition was filed, then using unlawful means to maintain their control of the industry and that the appellants were
                                    then by unlawful means excluding others from said industry.

                                    It is immaterial that this conspiracy had its inception prior to the enactment of the Sherman Law, or that many of the
                                    rebates and discriminations granted by the railroads which enabled the defendants to monopolize the commerce in
                                    petroleum antedated the enactment of the Interstate Commerce Act; the principles of the common law applied to

                                    From the earliest date these various corporations were held together by trust agreements which were void at
                                    common law.  But whether they were void or not, the combination was a continuing one; there was no vested right
                                    by reason of the acquisition of these stocks [****34]  by the trustees, and when the Sherman Act was passed the
                                    continuance of the combination became illegal.  United States v. Freight Association, 166 U.S. 290, cited and

                                    the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey) to the various marketing places throughout the United States, and in
                                    selling and disposing of the same.  This clearly makes the defendants engaged in interstate commerce.

                                    The Northern Securities Case and other authorities [****36]  cited under this head are conclusive of the proposition
                                    that this is a combination in restraint of trade.  The court held that the inhibitions of the Sherman Act were not
                                    limited to those direct restraints upon trade and commerce evidenced by contracts between independent lines of
                                    railway to fix rates or to maintain rates, or manufacturing or other corporations to limit the supply or control prices;
                                    that the power of suppression of competition and therefore of restraint of trade exercised or which could be
                                    exercised by reason of stock ownership and control of the various corporations, was as much in violation of the
                                    Anti-trust Act as direct restraint by contract.  There is nothing in the act which can be construed to prohibit the
                                    suppression of competition by reason of stock control of railways and at the same time to permit it in manufacturing
                                    221 U.S. 1, *1; 31 S. Ct. 502, **502; 55 L. Ed. 619, ***619; 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1725, ****32
                                    
                                    
                                    industries, pipe line companies, or car line companies engaged in the manufacture and transportation of oil.  The
                                    contracts, combinations in the form of trusts or otherwise, or conspiracies in restraint of trade, which are inhibited by
                                    the first section of the act as applied to these classes of corporations cannot be distinguished from those [****37]
                                    contracts, combinations in the form of trusts or otherwise, or conspiracies in restraint of trade, when applied to
                                    railway companies.  The thing inhibited is the restraint of interstate commerce.  The thing to be accomplished is the
                                    maintenance of the freedom of trade.  The inhibition against the suppression of competition by any instrumentality,
                                    scheme, plan or device, to evade the act, applies to all corporations and all devices.  The real point is not the
                                    instrumentality or the scheme used to suppress the competition, but whether competition is thus suppressed and
                                    trade restrained and monopolized.  Nowhere in the decisions of this court is there authority for the proposition that
                                    combinations by stock ownership or the purchase of competing properties is invalid as to railroads but valid as to
                                    trading and manufacturing companies.  The act of Congress and the decisions of this court, so far as the principle
                                    goes, places them upon the same plane.  In the argument of the Freight Association cases it was urged by counsel
                                    that the inhibitions of the Sherman Act in this regard did not apply to railroads, but only included trading companies.
                                    It is now urged that they apply to railroads [****38]  and do not apply to manufacturing and trading companies.  But
                                    this court in the Freight Association cases clearly laid down the rule that while there are points of difference existing
                                    between the two classes of corporations, yet they are all engaged in interstate commerce, that the injuries to the
                                    public have many common features, and that the inhibitions apply to all.  166 U.S. 322.
                                    The transfer of the stocks of these companies in 1899 to the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey had no greater
                                    legal sanctity than the transfer to the trustees in 1882, nor was it different from the transfer of the stocks of the
                                    Northern Pacific and Great Northern Railways to the Northern Securities Company in 1901, two years after the
                                    organization of the present corporate Standard Oil combination.  It is the usual course of reasoning urged in all of
                                    these trust cases -- because a person has a right to purchase property, he may therefore purchase a competitor,
                                    and because he may purchase one competitor he may purchase all of his competitors, and what an individual may
                                    do a corporation may do.  These were the identical arguments pressed with great ability by counsel in the Northern
                                    Securities Case and [****39]  in the subsequent case of Harriman v. Northern Securities Co., 197 U.S. 291; but this
                                    court held to the contrary.  The position is also contrary to the almost universal trend of the American decisions both
                                    Federal and state.  The exercise of an individual right disconnected from all other circumstances may be legal, but
                                    when taken together with the other circumstances may accomplish the prohibited thing.
                                    The second section of the act prohibits a person or a single corporation from monopolizing or attempting to
                                    monopolize any part of the commerce of the country by any means whatever, and also from conspiring with any
                                    other person or persons to accomplish the same object.  The two sections of the act were manifestly not intended to
                                    cover the same thing; otherwise the second section would be useless.  Any contract or combination in the form of a
                                    trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade which tends to monopoly is prohibited by the first section.

                                    The question then is: What is the meaning of the word ""monopoly,"" as used in the second section of the act?  Of
                                    course Congress did not [****40]  have in mind monopoly by legislative or executive grant.  National Cotton Oil Co.
                                    v. Texas, 197 U.S. 129; Burrows v. Inter. Met. Co., 156 Fed. Rep. 389, opinion by Judge Holt.  Such monopolies
                                    could not exist in this country except by grant of Congress or the States, and it has been held that exclusive grants
                                    to pursue an ordinary legitimate business are void.  Butchers' Union Co. v. Crescent City Co., 111 U.S. 754. Neither
                                    did Congress have in mind an absolute monopoly.  This can only be obtained by legislative grant.In a country like
                                    ours, where everyone is free to enter the field of industry, no absolute monopoly is probable.It is sufficient to bring it
                                    within the act if the combination or the aggregation of capital ""tends to monopoly . . . or are reasonably calculated to
                                    bring about the things forbidden."" Waters-Pierce Co. v. Texas, 212 U.S. 86. Originally monopoly meant a grant by
                                    sovereign power of the exclusive right to carry on any employment.  The only act of exclusion was the grant itself.  If
                                    the grant was void, then there was no monopoly.  These monopolies were common in all monarchial countries.
                                    Monopoly, however, came to have a broader meaning under the common law in [****41]  the later days, and
                                    expecially in the United States, and in order to arrive at what Congress intended by the act of 1890 it is important to
                                    understand the history of the times and the general understanding of monopoly as defined by the courts and the
                                    political economists, and the monopolies which were known to the people generally and against which Congress
                                    was legislating.  Prior to the passage of this law, the various trust cases had been decided, in which trusts, like the
                                    221 U.S. 1, *1; 31 S. Ct. 502, **502; 55 L. Ed. 619, ***619; 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1725, ****36
                                    
                                    
                                    Standard Oil of 1882, had been held illegal because they tended to create a monopoly.  People v. North River
                                    Sugar Refining Co., 54 Hun, 354; State v. Nebraska Distilling Co., 29 Nebraska, 700; State v. Standard Oil Co., 49
                                    Oh. St. 137. Various other decisions had defined monopoly as known in this country, -- such cases as Alger v.
                                    Thacher, 19 Pick. 51; People v. Chicago Gas Trust, 130 Illinois, 268; Salt Co. v. Guthrie, 35 Oh. St. 666; Craft v.
                                    McConoughy, 79 Illinois, 346; Central R.R. Co. v. Collins, 40 Georgia, 582.
                                    These cases were decided before the Sherman Act was passed, and defined monopoly at common law as it was
                                    understood and existed in this country.  They embrace trusts like the Standard Oil trust;  [****42]  agreements fixing
                                    prices, dividing territory, or limiting production, thereby tending to enhance or control the price of products; general
                                    agreements restraining individuals from engaging in any employment except as incident to the sale of property;
                                    purchases by corporations of all or a large proportion of competing manufacturing or mechanical plants;
                                    combinations of separate businesses in the form of partnership but really for the purpose of controlling the trade;
                                    and various other forms of acquiring monopoly.There was no unlawful exclusion of anyone else from doing
                                    business in these cases.  They show that the term ""monopoly"" as applied in American jurisprudence meant
                                    monopoly acquired by mere individual acts, as distinguished from grant of government, although the individual act
                                    in and of itself was not illegal; the concentration of business in the hands of one combination, corporation, or
                                    person, so as to give control of the product or prices; as said by Mr. Justice McKenna, in the Cotton Oil Case, ""all
                                    suppression of competition, by unification of interest or management.""
                                    The case of Craft v. McConoughy, supra, well illustrates this argument.  The pretended copartnership
                                    formed [****43]  between the dealers of the town of Rochelle, while carrying on the business separately, enabled
                                    them to control the prices to the detriment of the surrounding country.  It was therefore a monopolizing or an
                                    attempt to monopolize a part of the commerce of the State; and the monopolization would have been just as
                                    effective had these separate business enterprises been stock corporations and the stock placed in the hands of a
                                    holding company.  A similar illustration was the case of Smiley v. Kansas, 196 U.S. 447 (affirming 65 Kansas, 240),
                                    in which an attempt to control the grain trade of a particular station was held illegal under a state statute.  The
                                    Standard combination is an attempt to control and monopolize a vast commerce of the entire country, as these
                                    people undertook to control and monopolize a local commerce.
                                    The term ""monopoly,"" therefore, as used in the Sherman Act was intended to cover such monopolies or attempts to
                                    monopolize as were known to exist in this country; those which were defined as illegal at common law by the
                                    States, when applied to intrastate commerce, and those which were known to Congress when the act was passed.
                                    The monopoly most commonly known in this [****44]  country, and which the debates in Congress 1 show were
                                    intended to be prohibited by the act, were those acquired by combination (by purchase or otherwise) of competing
                                    concerns.  The purchase of a competitor, as a separate transaction standing alone, was the exercise of a lawful
                                    privilege, not in and of itself unlawful at common law nor prohibited by statute, yet in the Northern Securities Case
                                    the purchase of stock in a railway was held to be illegal when done in pursuance of a scheme of monopoly.
                                    It is not necessary in this case, and we doubt whether in any case it is possible, to make a comprehensive definition
                                    of monopoly which will cover every case that might arise.  It is sufficient if the case at bar clearly comes within the
                                    provisions of the act.  We believe that the defendants have acquired a monopoly by means of a combination of the
                                    principal manufacturing concerns through a holding company; that they have, by reason of the very size of the
                                    combination, been able to maintain this monopoly through unfair [****45]  methods of competition, discriminatory
                                    freight rates, and other means set forth in the proofs.  If this act did not mean this kind of monopoly, we doubt if
                                    there is such a thing in this country.  The men who framed the Constitution of this country were familiar with the
                                    history of monopolies growing out of acts of the Government.  They guarded the people against these by
                                    constitutional provisions, but they left open the widest field for the exercise of individual enterprise, and it was the
                                    abuse of these personal privileges, made easy by state laws permitting unlimited incorporation, which gave rise to
                                    the evils that convinced the people of the necessity for the passage of the Sherman Anti-trust Act.  It was not
                                    monopolies as known to the English common law, but monopolies such as were commonly understood to exist in
                                    this country which that act prohibited.

                                    As a natural conclusion from the foregoing definition of monopoly by appellants' counsel they claim that the
                                    inhibitions of the second section are against the unlawful means used to acquire the monopoly, but that acquired
                                    monopoly is not illegal; therefore that the court can only restrain the means by which the monopoly was acquired,
                                    [****46]  leaving the monopoly to exist.  We believe this to be an altogether too refined construction of the act.  If
                                    such be the true interpretation, the result would be that one could combine all the separate manufactures in a given
                                    branch of industry in this country by use of unlawful means such as discriminatory freight rates, but, if not attacked
                                    by the Government before it had obtained complete control of the business, its very size, with its ramifications
                                    through all the States, would make it impossible for anyone else to compete, and it could control the price of
                                    products in the entire country and would be beyond the reach of the law.  It could, by selling at a low price where a
                                    competitor was engaged in business and by raising the price where there was no attempt at competition, absolutely
                                    control the business without itself suffering any loss; and yet the Government would be powerless to destroy the
                                    monopoly because the unlawful means had been abandoned.
                                    If the court finds this combination to be in restraint of trade and a monopoly, it is authorized by § 3 to enjoin the
                                    same and has plenary power to make such decree as is necessary to enforce the terms and provisions of the act.

                                    The maintenance of free competition among railways has become the settled-policy of the Nation.
                                    [****7]  The Interstate Commerce Act, in its provisions against contracts, agreements, or combinations between
                                    common carriers for pooling, enforces the competitive principle.
                                    The Sherman Law, as construed by the courts, is directed against all attempts to suppress competition among
                                    interstate carriers or to monopolize interstate commerce.  National Cotton Oil Co. v. Texas, 197 U.S. 115; Northern

                                    This policy has found expression in the constitutions and laws of thirty-seven States and two Territories.
                                    The courts have recognized and enforced the policy, both under statutory and constitutional provisions, and also in

                                    The Government's brief contains a synopsis of the constitutional and statutory provisions of the several States and
                                    Territories on the subject of parallel and competing lines.
                                    Mr. N. H. Loomis and Mr. P. F. Dunne for appellees:
                                    The object which the Union Pacific had in view in acquiring an interest in the Southern Pacific, was not to suppress
                                    competition or to obtain a monopoly, but to secure a permanent relationship with the Southern Pacific [****13]
                                    which would insure for it a perpetual through line to San Francisco, as contemplated by Congress, and give to it as
                                    well, an entrance into all the traffic producing centers of California.
                                    As to the conception which Congress and the public had, of a single, indivisible line of railroad extending from the
                                    Missouri River, with continuous rails to the Pacific Ocean, see act of July 1, 1862.  Not only did Congress provide
                                    226 U.S. 61, *61; 33 S. Ct. 53, **53; 57 L. Ed. 124, ***124; 1912 U.S. LEXIS 2131, ****9
                                    
                                    
                                    for the permanent physical continuity of the proposed railroads, but gave power to any two or more of them to
                                    consolidate and thus place themselves under a single management.  §§ 10, 12, 16, act of July 1, 1862, 12 Stat.
                                    497; § 16, act of July 2, 1864, 13 Stat. 362.  See Ames v. Kansas, 111 U.S. 449.
                                    The hope and expectation of a single, indivisible line of railroad from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean could
                                    not be fully realized as long as the ownership was vested in separate corporations and the operation in different
                                    managements.
                                    It is clear from the testimony that the officials of the Union Pacific regarded the Southern Pacific not as a
                                    competitive, but as a connecting line.
                                    The testimony of the witnesses and the surrounding circumstances demonstrate [****14]  that the object and intent
                                    of purchasing the stock of the Southern Pacific, was to protect the integrity of the through line from the Missouri
                                    River to the Pacific coast and to procure for the Union Pacific a permanent entrance into interior California points; it
                                    was not to obtain a competing line or to stifle competition.
                                    This intent was shown by betterments.  As to deducting intent from actions of the parties see United States v.
                                    American Tobacco Company, 221 U.S. 106.
                                    The Southern Pacific was not bound to agree to joint tariffs under any law in force when the stock purchase was
                                    made.
                                    There was no law in 1901 by which that company could be forced to grant other than local rates between Ogden
                                    and San Francisco on traffic tendered to it by the Union Pacific; nor did the Pacific Railroad Act of July 2, 1864,
                                    which required the Union Pacific and the Central Pacific, as well as the other roads included therein, to be operated
                                    and used for all purposes of communication and travel so far as the public and Government are concerned as one
                                    continuous line extend to requiring joint tariffs.  L.R. &c.  R.R. Co. v. E.T. Va. & G., 2 I.C.C. Rep. 456, and 3 I.C.C.

                                    This court has [****15]  held that the fixing of rates is a legislative power which cannot be exercised by the courts.

                                    The want of power to compel railroads to enter into such agreements led to the adoption of the Hepburn Act, §§ 15,
                                    34 Stat. 590, and the Interstate Commerce Commission was authorized to establish through routes, fix rates and to
                                    determine the division of the through rate between connecting carriers; but as to the law prior thereto, see Southern
                                    Pacific v. Int. Com. Comm., 200 U.S. 536, 553; Chicago & N.W. Ry. v. Osborne, 52 Fed. Rep. 915.
                                    The want of legal power on the part of the Union Pacific to compel the Southern Pacific to recognize the usual
                                    incidents of a through route and the discretion possessed by the Southern Pacific to do as its own welfare might
                                    dictate with respect to through rates, gave to that company additional advantages, and made it possible for the
                                    Southern Pacific to more effectively control the situation.
                                    The so-called [****16]  Portland route to San Francisco is not a practicable one.  Union Pacific officials had
                                    frequently considered the opening of the Portland gateway for San Francisco traffic, but had always concluded that
                                    it would be an unprofitable move and therefore it was not done.One serious objection was the length of the line.
                                    Portland is substantially the same distance from Omaha as San Francisco is, and the rate to San Francisco through
                                    Portland would have to be the same as the rate via the short, direct line through Ogden; and the rate to Portland
                                    was the same as the rate to San Francisco.  The Union Pacific would receive no greater revenue for hauling freight
                                    through Portland to San Francisco than it would for the same freight delivered at Portland.
                                    As a matter of fact the Portland route to San Francisco has never been used, although it has been open, physically,
                                    since 1884.
                                    The most conclusive point, showing that the Portland route to San Francisco is and always has been, an
                                    impracticable one, is the fact that the Northern rail lines terminating at Seattle, Tacoma and Portland have never
                                    been able to carry any substantial amount of transcontinental traffic to or from San Francisco.
                                    226 U.S. 61, *61; 33 S. Ct. 53, **53; 57 L. Ed. 124, ***124; 1912 U.S. LEXIS 2131, ****13
                                    
                                    
                                    [****17]  The Government's argument is that the Portland route to San Francisco could have been used by the
                                    Union Pacific, in view of the successful operation of the Sunset line between New York and San Francisco via New
                                    Orleans by the Southern Pacific.  The conditions surrounding the operation of the Sunset route are so dissimilar,
                                    however, that it cannot be regarded as a parallel case.  In the first place it is operated under a single management
                                    from New York to San Francisco and California business is given preferred attention.  The freight is carried by boat
                                    from New York to New Orleans without stop, the California freight quickly transferred to cars waiting upon the
                                    wharves and transported in trainload lots to Los Angeles and San Francisco.  It is a service which cannot be
                                    duplicated by any other broken water and rail line.
                                    The traffic upon which complainant mainly relies to establish competitive relations between the Union Pacific and
                                    the Southern Pacific in 1901, was traffic between the Atlantic seaboard and the middle west on the one hand and
                                    California points on the other.  As to all this traffic the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific were not competitors, but
                                    connections, and in [****18]  a sense, partners.
                                    A railroad is not a competitor of its connections on business handled by them jointly under a through tariff.
                                    Southern Pacific v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 200 U.S. 536.
                                    In the Standard Oil Case, 221 U.S. 1, 80, this court recognized the legality of combining various pipe lines, in order
                                    to make a continuous line, and declared that an agreement or combination so to do would not be repugnant to the
                                    Sherman Act.
                                    Some of the reasons why Union Pacific was not a competitor of Southern Pacific's Sunset route are that it was a
                                    connection of the Southern Pacific, handling through business on a joint tariff, to which the Southern Pacific had
                                    voluntarily agreed.  In entering upon this relationship and agreeing to the joint tariff, the Union Pacific knew that the
                                    Southern Pacific possessed another line via New Orleans and that it would endeavor to route traffic that way and
                                    get the long haul whenever circumstances permitted it.  But notwithstanding that fact the Union Pacific was willing
                                    to continue the relationship.  As a matter of fact it had no choice about the matter; it was compelled to submit to
                                    these conditions.  The Southern Pacific was not only a partner [****19]  but a dominant partner -- a partner with
                                    which the Union Pacific was required to associate or go out of business.  With no rails of its own into California and
                                    no other railroad but the Southern Pacific to handle its California traffic, it was impossible for it to occupy the
                                    position of an independent, hostile competitor.
                                    The same principle is also controlling when we consider that as between the Union Pacific and the Southern
                                    Pacific, San Francisco is a local non-competitive point on the Southern Pacific, situated eight hundred miles distant
                                    from the western terminus of the Union Pacific.
                                    In the next place, the Government's argument assumes that two parts of the same railroad can compete with each
                                    other; that is to say, that that portion of the Southern Pacific Railroad extending from San Francisco to Ogden can
                                    compete with that portion thereof extending from San Francisco to New York.
                                    This assumption cannot be correct, as it is obvious that a railroad company cannot compete with itself.
                                    Furthermore, the Union Pacific was a constituent member of the Ogden route before the purchase, and it continued
                                    as such thereafter.  If the Ogden route, including the Union Pacific, competed [****20]  with the Sunset route before
                                    the purchase, it still competes with it; if it did not compete with it before the purchase, it does not compete with it
                                    now.  Competitive conditions between the two routes have not been changed by placing the Union Pacific and the
                                    Southern Pacific under a common management.
                                    As the Southern Pacific controlled the routing of California business, and the Union Pacific could obtain the
                                    business through the friendly interposition of that company only, it cannot be maintained that the Union Pacific was
                                    a competitor of the company it was dependent upon to get the business.
                                    If the Southern Pacific was a competitor of the Union Pacific on California business, because of the Sunset route,
                                    and the Union Pacific cannot own the stock of the Southern Pacific, then it will be impossible for any of the large
                                    railroads of the country to extend their lines by purchase or consolidation.  Every railroad with more than one
                                    226 U.S. 61, *61; 33 S. Ct. 53, **53; 57 L. Ed. 124, ***124; 1912 U.S. LEXIS 2131, ****16
                                    
                                    
                                    gateway is in the same predicament.  If the Government were devising a scheme to prevent the consolidation of all
                                    railroads, regardless of whether they were parallel or connecting lines, a better one could not have been concocted
                                    than the theory adopted [****21]  in this case.
                                    Another reason why the Union Pacific should not be considered as a competitor of the Southern Pacific on
                                    transcontinental business to and from California points is that it is but one link in the all-rail through line from the
                                    Atlantic seaboard to San Francisco, while the Southern Pacific has a continuous line from New York to San
                                    Francisco, under a single management.  The Union Pacific is dependent not only on the Southern Pacific on the
                                    west, but on its eastern connections as well, to fix a through rate or to maintain a through service; in itself it could do
                                    nothing without the voluntary cooperation of the lines extending east from Omaha or Kansas City.
                                    If one line is the competitor of another merely because both of them happen to be links in systems of through routes
                                    which compete with each other, practically every railroad in the United States is a competitor of every other railroad
                                    in the United States, and under those conditions not one line could purchase or consolidate with another line
                                    because of its being a competitor.
                                    Complainant's testimony as to the existence of separate soliciting agencies and of the consolidation of certain of
                                    those agencies subsequent [****22]  to 1901 does not prove that the Southern Pacific and Union Pacific were in
                                    competition with each other.
                                    All the large railroad systems in the United States have several gateways, representing different routes, through
                                    which their traffic may be handled; for instance, the New York Central, Pennsylvania and Baltimore & Ohio railroads
                                    have among others, their St. Louis and Chicago gateways; the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, its Omaha, Kansas
                                    City and St. Paul gateways; the Missouri Pacific, its Pueblo and El Paso gateways; the Southern Railway, its
                                    Memphis and New Orleans gateways; the Louisville & Nashville, its St. Louis, Memphis and New Orleans
                                    gateways.
                                    It is the effort of soliciting agents to secure business through these different gateways, as varying circumstances
                                    require them to solicit in favor of the one or the other, which induces the belief that there is competition between the
                                    routes represented by them, even though the agents may be working in the interests of the same carrier.  A brief
                                    consideration of the proposition will disclose its fallacy.
                                    Complainant's witnesses who expressed the opinion that the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific were competing
                                    upon California [****23]  business did so entirely upon the assumption that the rivalry of soliciting agents was the
                                    competition of railroads.  The testimony shows, however, how fallacious such testimony is and demonstrates that
                                    the strife for business may merely be the competition which is constantly going on between agents in the service of
                                    the same principal.
                                    As the work of soliciting agents against each other may be in pursuance of a common employment and the results
                                    of their labors for the benefit of the same railroad or combination of connecting railroads, testimony as to the rivalry
                                    of soliciting agents cannot be used to show the existence of competition between the routes which they represent.
                                    The fact that two railroads have separate soliciting agents does not necessarily prove that the railroads they
                                    represent are competitors.
                                    The Government itself asserts that the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific are not competing at the present time
                                    and yet it appears that there are separate soliciting agencies representing those companies at New York and San
                                    Francisco and other points.
                                    The other alleged competitive routes of minor importance did not make the Union Pacific and the Southern Pacific
                                    competitors [****24]  in any direct and substantial sense.
                                    In order to bring the competition within the inhibition of the Sherman Act, it must be direct and substantial.
                                    Competition which is indirect and remote is not competition within the meaning of the statute; traffic unsubstantial in
                                    amount is not included within the terms of the law.  When the Government seeks to set aside transactions as in
                                    restraint of trade and commerce, the burden rests upon it not only to prove the restraint of commerce, but the
                                    restraint of a substantial volume of commerce.  It must affirmatively show that the competition was of some practical
                                    importance and that the restraint of commerce involved was unreasonable.

                                    The Sherman Act was not intended to apply to combinations whose effect upon interstate commerce was indirect or
                                    incidental only, or which might remotely affect that commerce.  United States v. Joint Traffic Assn., 171 U.S. 505,
                                    568.
                                    This court puts contracts which only indirectly and incidentally restrain interstate commerce upon the same basis
                                    with respect to validity as legislation of the States, of which there are numerous examples, which incidentally and
                                    indirectly affect interstate commerce and yet are [****25]  valid because it is not a direct regulation of such
                                    commerce.  Anderson v. United States, 171 U.S. 604, 615, and Addyston Pipe and Steel Co. v. United States, 175
                                    U.S. 211, 229.
                                    This court held in one of the most important and farreaching decisions ever announced by it, that the Sherman Act
                                    does not prohibit every contract, combination, etc., in restraint of trade, but only those which unreasonably restrain
                                    trade and commerce.  Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 1; United States v. Am. Tobacco Co., 221 U.S.
                                    106; Cincinnati Packet Co. v. Bay, 200 U.S. 179; Phillips v. Cement Co., 125 Fed. Rep. 594; Kimball v. Atchison &c.
                                    Ry. Co., 46 Fed. Rep. 888; State v. Cent. of Ga. Ry., 109 Georgia, 716.
                                    Treating all of the traffic over the various routes of minor importance as competitive and considering it in the
                                    aggregate, it is a mere bagatelle when compared with the entire traffic of the Union Pacific and the Southern
                                    Pacific.  It amounts to only 0.88 per cent of the tonnage of the Southern Pacific and to only 3.10 per cent. of the
                                    tonnage of the Union Pacific, while the revenue of the Southern Pacific from this traffic aggregates only 1.25 per
                                    cent of its total revenue, an amount [****26]  which it is not conceivable that the Union Pacific would have cared to
                                    invest millions in Southern Pacific stock to suppress.  See Rogers v. Nashville &c.  Ry. Co., 91 Fed. Rep. 299, and
                                    cases supra.
                                    The purchase of the stock of the Northern Pacific and the Santa Fe by defendants, and the settlement of right of
                                    way controversies with the Clark interests, which resulted in the joint construction and ownership of the San Pedro
                                    road, were not acts performed with the object of suppressing competition or of acquiring a monopoly, nor did they
                                    have that effect.
                                    A review of the entire record demonstrates that a monopoly has not been created, that there has been no
                                    suppression of competition, and that there was no conspiracy to effectuate either purpose.  The record shows, on
                                    the other hand, that the interest which the Union Pacific acquired in the Southern Pacific has been of direct and
                                    substantial benefit to trade and commerce.
                                    The Union Pacific ownership of Southern Pacific stock was not a control, and did not import, as a matter of law, the
                                    power in any view of the case to restrict competition.  The Union Pacific merely became a minority stockholder,
                                    having by its first purchase acquired [****27]  only about 37 1/2 per cent of the stock and never acquired a majority.
                                    While the Union Pacific may have been able to keep control with less than a majority of stock there was always a
                                    possibility that it could not do so.  Stock control condemned by this court has been of an actual majority.  Pearsall v.
                                    Great Northern Ry., 161 U.S. 671; Northern Securities Case, 120 Fed. Rep. 726; S.C., 193 U.S. 106; Noyes on

                                    The acquisition and ownership by the Union Pacific of the Huntington stock by out and out sale to it by a
                                    stockholder in the market, is not, as such, within the power of Congress to regulate, under the commerce clause of
                                    the Constitution.  United States v. Knight Co., 156 U.S. 1.
                                    The acquisition and ownership of property by a corporation or citizen of a State is not interstate commerce.  The
                                    Union Pacific is a Utah corporation and had power to purchase stock of the Southern Pacific.  Nat. Bank v.
                                    Matthews, 98 U.S. 628; St. Louis R.R. v. Terre Haute R.R., 145 U.S. 407; Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168.
                                    A state corporation is subject to regulation by Congress only to the extent and by the measure [****28]  of its
                                    engagement in interstate commerce.  Employers' Liability Cases, 207 U.S. 463, 499. See Ashley v. Ryan, 153 U.S.
                                    436, 442; Louisville & Nashville Case, 161 U.S. 677; Mobile &c.  R.R. Co. v. Mississippi, 210 U.S. 187, 202.
                                    226 U.S. 61, *61; 33 S. Ct. 53, **53; 57 L. Ed. 124, ***124; 1912 U.S. LEXIS 2131, ****24
                                    
                                    
                                    The authority of the several States to permit railroads within their respective territory to consolidate on terms
                                    prescribed by each is inconsistent with the assertion of a power of Congress to the same effect, as it could only
                                    prescribe a uniform rule.
                                    The purchase by the Union Pacific of the Huntington stock by out and out sale is not within the purview of the
                                    Sherman Law.  An out and out sale is quite distinguishable from a collateral stipulation or covenant running with the
                                    sale.
                                    The combination or conspiracy prohibited by the Sherman Law is essentially a process terminable in future.  It is not
                                    like a sale completed when made.  Mitchell v. Reynolds, 1 P. Wms. 181. For some of these collateral agreements to

                                    Something more than the acquisition of a competing property is necessary to [****29]  bring the purchaser and

                                    (1) The trial court erred in overruling the demurrer because of the defect of parties plaintiff. The State would be the
                                    only authorized plaintiff, yet the petition in no manner alleges that the State brings the suit or is plaintiff. R.S. 1909,

                                    sustaining the demurrer, for defects in not alleging the necessary party plaintiff to be the State, and the body of the
                                    petition alone demonstrates the party moving. State v. Matson, 38 Mo. 489; Higgins v. Railroad, 36 Mo. 418;

                                    because of defect of parties plaintiff, in that the action should be ""for the use"" of the city of St. Louis, in accord with
                                    the Constitution, since all such fines and penalties go direct to the school fund. The provision (Sec. 10304) in this
                                    law for payment into the State Treasury is unconstitutional. Constitution of Missouri, art.  [***2]  11, sec. 8; In re
                                    Stead, 116 Mo. 537; R.S. 1909, sec. 3030; State v. Land Co., 97 Mo. App. 226. (4) The trial court erred in
                                    overruling the demurrer because there is no allegation in the petition that defendant ever had any connection with
                                    any contract or understanding or other agreement illegal under the law against pools, trusts and monopolies. The
                                    omission to file the affidavit of innocence, without such allegations and proof, is no ground to forfeit the charter of
                                    defendant. R.S. 1909, sec. 10304. While the terms of section 10322 may appear at first glance to warrant forfeiture,
                                    they are to be read along with section 10304 in pari materia, and together the paramount intent is to forfeit for
                                    breach of the law. Want of affidavit warrants beginning of suit (if the requirement be valid) but that alone is not

                                    sufficient to forfeit the charter. R.S. 1909, sec. 10298; Taylor v. Taylor, 10 Minn. 107; Edelstein v. U. S., 149 Fed.
                                    636. The entire chapter on pools, trusts and conspiracies should be included and considered in reaching the intent
                                    of section 10322, and the literal terms of the latter (or rather its implication) as to forfeiture should be narrowed in
                                    order to harmonize with section [***3]  10304, which defines the controlling purpose of the whole enactment. That is
                                    necessary according to established rules for interpretation of statutes. State v. Emerson, 39 Mo. 89; State v. King,
                                    44 Mo. 283; State v. Diveling, 66 Mo. 375; State v. Hemen, 70 Mo. 441; Cole v. Skrainka, 105 Mo. 303; Kane v.
                                    Railroad, 112 Mo. 34. (5) The trial court erred in not sustaining the demurrer (on the last ground thereof) because
                                    the required statutory affidavit of innocence (recited in the petition) cannot lawfully be demanded of any officer of
                                    defendant, in that the statement exacted therein that the company has not, ""at any time within one year"" from the
                                    date of the affidavit, participated in any of the forbidden agreements, is ex post facto and makes the requirement
                                    inconsistent with section 10304, as well as unconstitutional and void. Constitution of Mo., art. 2, sec. 15; State ex
                                    rel. v. Hardware Co., 109 Mo. 118. (6) The trial court erred in not sustaining the demurrer because the petition does
                                    not state a cause of action, in that a proceeding by quo warranto, either ancient, original, or by information of that
                                    nature, is essential to obtain forfeiture of franchise of a business corporation.  [***4]  R.S. 1909, sec. 2631. Section
                                    10322 does not conflict with or repeal section 2631, nor authorize any other proceeding than by quo warranto to
                                    forfeit such a charter. (7) The trial court erred in not sustaining the demurrer to the petition because the form of the
                                    affidavit demanded of innocence by the officers of defendant could only be made in a county, and no authority to
                                    alter the form in any respect is given by the law to company officers in St. Louis City. Hence, they could not swear
                                    to same in its procrustean form without being penalized under section 10324. R.S. 1909, sec. 10322. (8) The trial
                                    court, by refusing the peremptory instruction for defendant, denied to defendant and its officers the equal protection
                                    of the laws guaranteed to them by the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution, and denied to defendant and
                                    its officers their rights and immunities thereby secured, in that it is unreasonable and oppressive to require
                                    corporate officers to make such an affidavit of innocence, and yet to leave every ""partnership, individual or
                                    association of individuals"" (also within the law against monopolies, sections 10299, 10303) in the same situation
                                    and circumstances immune from [***5]  such requirement. Railroad v. Ellis, 165 U.S. 150; Paddock v. Railroad, 155
                                    Mo. 524. (9) The trial court erred in not finding for defendant because the requirement of the affidavit of innocence
                                    is not validated by the supposed immunity defined in section 10325, because as to the affidavit the immunity is not
                                    complete and not commensurate with the constitutional guaranty to the officers of the defendant against the giving
                                    of a self-incriminating affidavit. State ex rel. v. Hardware Co., 109 Mo. 118; Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547;

                                    (1) The requirement in Sec. 10322, R.S. 1909, that an affidavit be made is not void as violative of the Constitution
                                    which provides that ""no person shall be compelled to testify against himself in a criminal cause,"" because that
                                    section provides that ""no person shall be subject to any criminal prosecution on account of any matter or thing
                                    truthfully disclosed by the affidavit."" The immunity afforded by the statute is coextensive [***6]  with the
                                    constitutional privilege of silence, and it is sufficient. R.S. 1909, sec. 10325; People ex rel. v. Foundry and Iron Co.,

                                    corporation the ""equal protection of the laws,"" although it applies only to corporations and exempts individuals and
                                    partnerships. People ex rel. v. Foundry Co., 201 Ill. 236; State ex inf. v. Oil Co., 218 Mo. 368; Land & Fruit Co. v.

                                    the affidavit to be filed, and to provide that a failure in that regard should subject the offending party to a penalty to
                                    be adjudged against it by the courts. People ex rel. v. Foundry Co., 201 Ill. 236; Kaiser Land Co. v. Curry, 103 Pac.
                                    341. This is a proceeding under article 3 of chapter 98, R.S. 1909, not under article 1 of said chapter. Section
                                    10304, by its terms, applies only to violations of the provisions of article 1, and section 10322 does not refer to
                                    section 10304. (4)  [***7]  This is a proceeding authorized and provided by statute (section 10322) to enforce a
                                    statutory requirement. A statement of the facts under the statute is all that is required of the pleading. (5) This
                                    proceeding was brought by the circuit attorney ""in the name of the State and at the relation of the circuit attorney,""
                                    as required by statute, and the petition is sufficient in its allegations as to parties. R.S. 1909, secs. 10322, 1794,

                                    be brought ""for the use of the city of St. Louis."" State v. Newell, 140 Mo. 282; Cunningham v. Railroad, 165 Mo.

                                    process of law."" (7) The word ""county"" in section 10322 includes the ""city of St. Louis."" R.S. 1909, sec. 8057, rule

                                    tending to prove that the defendants and all other members of the traders' exchange boycotted and threatened
                                    others not members of their exchange for and from doing business with the plaintiff. (3) In order to constitute a

                                    4221. (4) ""The rule of reason"" is excluded by our statutes, and any combination which tends to limit or control or
                                    lessen trade or competition, no matter how little, falls within the condemnation of the antitrust laws of this State.
                                    State v. People's Ice Co., 246 Mo. 221. (5) As a matter of law an agreement between defendants or between them
                                    and other members of the traders exchange not to buy from or sell to the plaintiff's customers through the plaintiff,
                                    was a combination,  [***3]  agreement, trust, pool, association and conspiracy, etc., to restrain and limit trade and
                                    competition at this great cattle market at the stockyards in Kansas City, and whether such limitation or restraint of
                                    trade was ""great or small,"" the law was violated. State ex rel. v. People's Ice Co., 246 Mo. 221. (6) ""It is the

                                    our antitrust statutes are in pari materia and must be construed as if contained in one act. Hence it follows that
                                    section 8981 in article 2 of chapter 143, relating to pools, trusts and conspiracies, Revised Statutes 1899, which
                                    gives triple damages to any person injured in his property or business arising from any violation of that article, also
                                    gives such triple damages arising from any violation of any provisions [***4]  of article 1 of said chapter 143. State

                                    late to challenge the constitutionality of our antitrust statutes for the alleged reason that they interfere with the right
                                    to contract or take property without compensation, or due process of law, or deny any person the equal protection
                                    of the law. All these questions have long since been foreclosed and settled by this court. Standard Oil Case, 218
                                    Mo. 378. (9) The case of Anderson v. United States, 171 U.S. 604, so much relied on by the defendants, is not in
                                    point. All that case decided, as has been held by the Court of Appeals of this State and the Supreme Court of
                                    Kansas, was that the members of the traders exchange were not engaged in interstate commerce; and therefore
                                    the Sherman Act did not apply. Brewing Co. v. Belinder, 97 Mo. App. 64; State v. Wilson, 84 Pac. 737. Furthermore
                                    as pointed out in State ex rel. v. Live Stock Exchange, 211 Mo. 197, and State v. Aikens, 83 Kan. 792, all the rules
                                    of the traders exchange were not before the court in the Anderson case, especially the rule requiring the payment of
                                    a thousand [***5]  dollar entrance fee, and the approval of two-thirds of the members before any person could enter
                                    the portals of the exchange and be a trader on the yards with none to molest or make him afraid. Besides, it may be
                                    said that when the Anderson case was decided this antitrust legislation was a sort of a ""Mysterious Stranger"" -- to
                                    be kept at a dignified and perfectly proper distance -- and did not meet with the cordial reception and hearty
                                    welcome which its great virtues entitled it to, and which it has since, upon better acquaintance, been accorded,
                                    especially by the Supreme Court of this State. (10) The statutes so far as they provide for a civil suit to recover triple
                                    damages are not penal. Atlanta v. Foundry & Pipe Works, 127 F. 23; Casey v. Transit Co., 116 Mo. App. 250. (11)
                                    It is settled in this State that the enforcement and construction of these antitrust statutes is not to be ""approached
                                    with a sour face,"" but these statutes are remedial and must be liberally construed, so as to advance the remedy for
                                    the great wrongs therein denounced. It is the policy and purpose of the law that these statutes shall be rigidly
                                    enforced against all wrongdoers, and that the guilty shall not escape [***6]  through any astute or artificial
                                    construction which subverts the general intent of the lawmakers -- which was to destroy the whole brood of trusts
                                    and combines against trade in this State, from the least unto the greatest. State v. Oil Co., 218 Mo. 359; State ex
                                    inf. v. Ins. Co., 152 Mo. 43. (12) The antitrust laws apply to commission merchants. The learned counsel for the
                                    appellants, neither at the trial of the case below nor in their briefs in this court, made any claim or point that the
                                    antitrust statutes did not apply to combines or boycotts against commission merchants, and therefore we did not
                                    argue that point or submit any authorities. In State ex rel. v. Live Stock Exchange, 211 Mo. 181, this court passed
                                    upon the very question, and held that the statute did apply to commission merchants, members of the Kanass City
                                    Live Stock Exchange. See, also, State v. Wilson, 73 Kan. 334. So the record in this case shows that all the live
                                    stock -- cattle, hogs and sheep -- which comes to Kansas City is sent to commission merchants and sold by them. It
                                    is true that they sell on commission and do not own the stock, but they are the parties who actually sell it on the
                                    market, and for the most [***7]  part the owners never know for what the stock is sold until after a report of the sales
                                    is made. The commission men represent the owners, stand in the place of the owners and they are certainly bound
                                    and controlled by the antitrust laws of this State. And they can enter into an agreement and combine for the
                                    purpose of restraining trade and competition, or of lessening or raising prices, or doing anything which the owner
                                    himself could do in violation of the antitrust law. The antitrust law was primarily enacted for the purpose of
                                    protecting the producers and the consumers of farm products and other necessaries of life from combinations or
                                    260 Mo. 324, *324; 168 S.W. 934, **934; 1914 Mo. LEXIS 120, ***2
                                    
                                    
                                    monopolies which affect the prices or which tend to lessen competition in the trade. It is well known that nearly all of
                                    the food products, both raw material and finished, are for the most part handled by commission men, who, of all
                                    others, are in a position to enter into combines affecting the prices and trade and competition in the same. Butter,
                                    eggs, cheese, potatoes, flour, sugar, apples, oranges, lemons, fruits of all kinds, live stock -- cattle, hogs, sheep,
                                    goats -- poultry are bought and sold, and the prices are fixed, as a matter of fact,  [***8]  by commission merchants.
                                    And this antitrust statute was passed mainly, for the very purpose of protecting the producers and consumers of
                                    these food stuffs -- the farmers and the town people -- from combines and trusts formed by commission men.
                                    Therefore, to read them out of the benefits or the penalties of these statutes, would be to defeat the primary
                                    purpose of the law. There is nothing in the statutes saying that the combines or contracts or agreements in restraint
                                    of trade, condemned by the statutes, can only be or must be made by the owners of the products. But the statute
                                    says, ""If any two or more persons or corporations who are engaged in buying or selling any article of commerce,""
                                    Sec. 8978, R. S. 1899; that ""all arrangements, contracts, agreements or combination between persons or
                                    corporations, or between persons or any association of persons or corporations, designed or made with a view to
                                    lessen, or which tend to lessen, full and free competition,"" Sec. 8966, R. S. 1899; and ""Any person who shall
                                    create, enter into, become a member of or participate in any pool, trust, agreement, combination, confederation or
                                    understanding with any person or persons in restraint of trade [***9]  or competition,"" Sec. 8965. The same
                                    language is used in the revised law of 1907. So that it is nowhere suggested or implied in any section of the statute,
                                    or in any of the language used, that a vicious agreement in restraint of trade can only be made by the owners of the
                                    produce; but it is assumed that such agreements may be made by others, to-wit, by their agents and other persons
                                    engaged in the actual business of buying or selling or fixing the prices, such as commission merchants. To hold
                                    otherwise would be to expose the producers of food stuffs (the farmers) and the consumers (the town people) to all
                                    the evils which the statute so clearly intended to prevent. This cannot be the law. The section of the statute
                                    providing the remedy says that ""any person injured in his business"" by a violation of the statute shall have a cause
                                    of action. He does not have to be the owner of anything, but if his business is injured or destroyed by an illegal
                                    combine, he can recover his damages. These statutes are highly salutary and remedial in their purpose, and are
                                    not to be destroyed or repealed by a strict or hostile construction. State v. Oil Co., 218 Mo. 359, 384, 460; State ex
                                    inf. v. Ins. Co.,  [***10]  152 Mo. 43; State ex inf. v. Oil Co., 194 Mo. 148; State ex inf. v. Packing Co., 173 Mo. 356.
                                    All who are engaged in trade must be embraced in these antitrust laws, otherwise they are void as discriminatory
                                    and invading the equal protection of the law provisions of the Federal Constitution. The first Illinois antitrust law
                                    was declared void because it exempted ""live stock while in the hands of the raiser."" Connolly v. Pipe Co., 184 U.S.

                                    was organized for the express purpose of limiting and destroying free competition, and that respondents have been

                                    Company was organized as a means and instrumentality through which to continue and perpetuate the various
                                    methods of combination which existed prior to its organization and through which methods the large packing
                                    interests of the United States were brought into an unlawful combine. This being true, various decisions of appellate

                                    369. (5) Independent of whether the National Packing Company was organized as a part and in pursuance of a
                                    former pool and combine, it was organized for the purpose, or, at least, provides a means through which the
                                    Armour Packing interests, the Swift Packing interests, the Morris Packing interests and the various subsidiary [***5]
                                    concerns, including the respondents, can and do lessen competition. Respondents are therefore guilty of the
                                    charges contained in the information. Cases cited under Point 4; United States v. Tobacco Co., 164 Fed. 700;

                                    Oil Co., 49 Ohio St. 137. (6) Independent of the means which the National Packing Company affords, the Armour
                                    interest, the Morris interests, and the Swift interests meeting together with the representatives of respondents and
                                    jointly agreeing upon the affairs of these various interests, it is an unlawful combine, to which respondents are
                                    parties, in that it effectively destroys all competition and removes all incentive for competition among the various
                                    corporations, including the respondents, owned and controlled by the [***6]  National Packing Company. Cases
                                    cited under Points 4 and 5, supra; State ex rel. v. Jockey Club, 200 Mo. 32; Terrett v. Taylor, 9 Cranch, 51;

                                    unconstitutionality raised by respondents in their answer to these statutes are untenable, having all been foreclosed
                                    by prior decisions of this court and the United States Supreme Court. They are no longer open questions in this

                                    (A) The information is in nowise supported by the proofs. (1) Where, as here, quo warranto proceeds against a
                                    corporation for a violation of the antitrust law, the information must charge the specific wrong-doing, and the proofs
                                    must show that which is thus specifically pleaded. State ex rel. v. Talbot, 123 Mo. 71; State ex rel. v. Grimm,  [***7]
                                    220 Mo. 490; State ex rel. v. Railroad, 240 Mo. 35; State ex rel. v. Railroad, 241 Mo. 11. If the evidence does not
                                    show the specific wrong-doing so alleged, there is not simply a variance but a complete failure of proof. Waldhier v.
                                    Railroad, 71 Mo. 514; Reed v. Bott, 100 Mo. 62; McManamee v. Railroad, 135 Mo. 440; Huston v. Tyler, 140 Mo.
                                    263; Chitty v. Railroad, 148 Mo. 75; Richardson v. Busch, 198 Mo. 174. (2) If a material fact be pleaded as
                                    unknown to the pleader, there is a complete failure of proof if it appear that such fact was either known or could
                                    have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence. State v. Stowe, 132 Mo. 208; State v. Thompson,
                                    137 Mo. 623; State v. Moses, 139 Mo. 217; State v. Burke, 151 Mo. 145; State v. Nunley, 185 Mo. 109; Naftzger v.
                                    United States, 118 C. C. A., 200 Fed. 501. (3) The specific charge in the information was this: Respondents, not as
                                    passive instruments, but as active conspirators, with unknown parties, conspired to take over, own and control all
                                    the packing companies in Missouri and the United States, the names of which were unknown, and pursuant to the
                                    scheme the National Company acquired the stock and assets of corporations [***8]  whose names were likewise
                                    unknown. Both the proofs and the commissioner's report clearly showed: (a) There was never any purpose of
                                    obtaining control of all of such packing houses; (b) the alleged conspirators were Swift & Company, Armour &
                                    Company, Morris & Company and the companies actually acquired by the National Company, and (c) the names of
                                    these companies were actually disclosed at a preliminary hearing had under the statute (R. S. 1909, secs. 10332-
                                    10338) by the Attorney-General to see whether there was any reason for filing the information. Moreover, if such
                                    examination did not disclose the facts in every detail, they could have been ascertained by his asking for the
                                    production of the officers and directors and the books and papers of the companies doing business in Missouri. (B)
                                    The proofs were insufficient to make a case. (1) The commissioner's mere conclusion, in the teeth of findings to the
                                    contrary and his statement that there was no direct evidence to that effect, was that respondents were in a
                                    combination with Swift & Company, Armour & Company and the National Company. (2) Such a conclusion cannot
                                    be warranted by strong suspicions or probabilities, but can only be drawn [***9]  upon a clear showing of (a) either a
                                    criminal intent to violate the law, or (b) a combination of such magnitude as to create a monopoly. State ex inf. v.
                                    Tobacco Co., 177 Mo. 37; United States v. Naval Stores Co., 172 Fed. 460; Bigelow v. Mining Co., 167 Fed. 709,
                                    94 C. C. A. 13. (3) Here, both the findings and proofs clearly show there was no monopoly, while the facts do not
                                    warrant a finding of bad intent. (4) There not being a monopoly guilt cannot be found from the size of the business
                                    unaccompanied by improper acts or oppressive methods towards competitors. United States v. Naval Stores Co.,
                                    172 Fed. 458; Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 1; Tobacco Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 106; State ex
                                    inf. v. Harvester Co., 237 Mo. 394. (5) There was individual ownership of the stock of the National Company by G.
                                    F. Swift, J. O. Armour and Edward Morris, heads of Swift & Company, Armour & Company and Morris & Company.
                                    The National Company in turn owned the stock of respondents. From this alone the commissioner concluded not
                                    that there was any, but that there might be an abuse of the power flowing from such ownership, hence guilt. This
                                    was contrary to the law. State ex inf. v. [***10]  Tobacco Co., 117 Mo. 37; State ex inf. v. Standard Oil Co., 194 Mo.
                                    155, 218 Mo. 403; State ex inf. v. Railroad, 241 Mo. 1, 11; Bigelow v. Mining Co., 167 Fed. 721, 94 C. C. A. 13; U.
                                    S. v. Reading Co., 183 Fed. 427. (6) The proposed but abandoned consolidation of 1902 would have controlled not
                                    more than fifty-two per cent of the packing business. Its size alone, regardless of its abuse of its power, would not
                                    have made it illegal. United States v. Naval Stores Co., 172 Fed. 458; Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U.S.
                                    1; Tobacco Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 106; State ex inf. v. Harvester Co., 237 Mo. 369, 394. The plan having
                                    been abandoned, it was not evidence of a combination thereafter. U. S. v. Reading Co., 183 Fed. 427. (7) The
                                    conclusions of the commissioner are not only contrary to the proofs, but they are inconsistent with the specific facts
                                    found. (8) The claim of violation of law is too stale to warrant a prosecution. A State, by lapse of time, wholly
                                    irrespective of any Statute of Limitation, loses its right to proceed in quo warranto, not only as against municipal
                                    (State ex rel. v. Westport, 116 Mo. 582; People ex rel. v. Alturas Co., 6 Idaho, 418; State v. School [***11]  District,

                                    In comprehensive terms the substance of the charge is: (1) That between 1898 and 1900 combinations were
                                    formed in various branches of the iron and steel trade, not as an incident of normal growth, but with the purpose
                                    and effect of unduly restricting competition, and that they still exist, contrary to the Anti-Trust Act of July 2, 1890.
                                    (2) That in 1901, by means of a holding company, these several illegal combinations, each dominant in its
                                    respective field, and other powerful units, were all brought together in one super-combination of overwhelming
                                    power,  [****5]  which, augmented by further acquisitions, still exists, unduly restricting competition in the iron and
                                    steel trade as a whole and in practically every important branch thereof, contrary to the same act of Congress.
                                    1 At the former hearing the case was argued by Mr. Solicitor General Davis, Mr. Assistant to the Attorney General Todd and Mr.
                                    Henry E. Colton, Special Assistant to the Attorney General.  Mr. Attorney General Gregory and Mr. Robert Szold also were on
                                    the brief, from which the argument is abstracted.
                                    251 U.S. 417, *417; 40 S. Ct. 293, **293; 64 L. Ed. 343, ***343; 1920 U.S. LEXIS 1630, ****2
                                    
                                    
                                    The several combinations formed during the period 1898-1900 greatly increased prices in almost every instance,
                                    especially the combinations affecting the lighter finished products, such as tubes, wire nails, tin plates, etc.  Prices
                                    of pig iron, semi-finished products and rails also were increased.  But notwithstanding the concentration of control in
                                    particular lines resulting from these combinations, competition was still able to make itself felt, taking the industry
                                    as [****6]  a whole, and as the year 1900 drew to a close was threatening to become very active, and, with the
                                    revival of active competition, prices, which had been enormously increased, underwent substantial declines.  Then
                                    was formed the present corporation -- a holding company, which controls the important acts and policies of the
                                    constituent combinations, and, among other things, generally determines the prices which they may charge for their
                                    finished products.  As the proposal for the super-combination began to take form, prices, which had receded with
                                    the revival of competition in the latter half of 1900, began to rise again.  The upward movement became marked as
                                    the organization of the combination was perfected.  While some have since fallen, these prices have nevertheless
                                    been maintained by the combination at a substantially higher level than prevailed during competitive periods prior to
                                    its formation.
                                    Except for the internal alterations and further acquisitions, which increased the control, the several combinations
                                    above described and the super-combination in which they were all united have continued down to the present time
                                    without change of substance.  Their proportion of the trade,  [****7]  whilst not quite so great as at first, is still
                                    overwhelmingly preponderant.
                                    Congress was moved to pass the Anti-Trust Act by two main considerations: (1) The desire to preserve the
                                    competitive system of industry.  (2) The conviction that that system was threatened by the undue concentration of
                                    commercial power resulting chiefly from the unrestricted exercise of the right of combination.
                                    Every combination which by its necessary effect or because of the character of the means employed threatens the
                                    normal operation of the law of competition, in other words, unduly restricts competition, is therefore within the
                                    purview of the act.
                                    It was not intended, however, to set a limit to the enlargement of a business by normal growth, the competitive
                                    system being in no danger from that quarter.
                                    The purpose of the parties is important in determining the question of normal growth, but, that out of the way, it is of
                                    no further consequence where the necessary effect of the combination is unduly to restrict competition.
                                    Except as throwing light on the purpose of the parties, it is immaterial how the combination is created, whether
                                    through simple agreement, through the old from of trust, through [****8]  a holding company, or through the actual
                                    purchase and consolidation of plants.
                                    Competition may be unduly restricted through voluntary combinations of competitive traders and trade units no less
                                    than by combinations to exclude one or more such from their right to trade.
                                    Whether restriction of competition through voluntary combinations is undue depends primarily upon the extent of
                                    the restriction.  Without attempting to draw the exact line, the restriction is certainly undue where the combination
                                    embraces units which together occupy a preponderant position in a given industry.
                                    What constitutes a preponderant position must be determined in the light of conditions in the particular branch of
                                    trade affected.  The principal factors to be considered are (1) the portion of the trade engrossed by the combination
                                    as compared with the portion possessed by each of its competitors as well as with the whole, and (2) the extent of
                                    the control, if any, acquired by the combination over raw materials or over the agencies of transportation and of
                                    distribution or over the reserve supply where the article of trade is one the supply of which is limited by nature.
                                    At the time they were combined under [****9]  the control of the United States Steel Corporation the American Steel
                                    & Wire Company, the American Tin Plate Company, the American Sheet Steel Company, the American Steel Hoop
                                    Company, the National Tube Company and the American Bridge Company were severally combinations in restraint
                                    of trade, each being a combination of formerly competitive units together occupying an overwhelmingly
                                    preponderant position in a distinct branch of the iron and steel trade and each having been organized for the
                                    purpose of suppressing competition and increasing prices.
                                    251 U.S. 417, *417; 40 S. Ct. 293, **293; 64 L. Ed. 343, ***343; 1920 U.S. LEXIS 1630, ****5
                                    
                                    
                                    It has never been doubted that combinations of this type, embracing a dominant proportion of those engaged in a
                                    particular industry and formed for the express purpose of suppressing competition between them, are combinations
                                    in restraint of trade.  Addyston Pipe Co. v. United States, 175 U.S. 211; Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 375,
                                    394; Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. Park & Sons Co.; 220 U.S. 273, 408. Nor is it material, their purpose and effect being
                                    what they were, that the combinations here assailed were created in corporate form instead of by loose agreement.
                                    United States v. American Tobacco Co. [****10]  , 221 U.S. 106, 176, 181. Indeed, where, as here, corporations
                                    simply exchange their plants and businesses for stock in a consolidated corporation, the resulting combination is in
                                    no respect different in principle from a combination in the form of trust which the statute specifically prohibits.
                                    Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U.S. 197, 326, 327; United States v. Reading Co., 226 U.S. 324, 352-
                                    363; s.c. 183 Fed. Rep. 427, 470; Patterson v. United States, 222 Fed. Rep. 599, 619, 620 Noyes, Intercorporate
                                    Relations, § 354; Eddy, combinations, § 622.  Wherefore we submit that the illegality of these combinations is not
                                    merely debatable, as the defendants themselves admit as to some, but is conclusive as to all.  They were still
                                    occupying the illegal position thus acquired in various branches of the steel trade when united under the control of
                                    the United States Steel Corporation in 1901.
                                    The Steel Corporation is a combination in restraint of trade, because it is not the result of natural trade growth but is
                                    a mere instrumentality for combining competing corporations which together occupy an overwhelmingly
                                    preponderant position in trade and [****11]  commerce in iron and steel products generally.  The group of
                                    independent plants and businesses combined under on control through the corporation included the largest and
                                    most powerful competitors in practically every branch of the iron and steel industry in rails; plates; structural shapes;
                                    wire rods and wire products; hoops, bands, and cotton ties; skelp; wrought pipe and tubular goods; seamless tubes;
                                    bars; billets and sheet bars.  And not only were the competitors united under the control of the Corporation the
                                    largest and most powerful units in practically every branch of the iron and steel industry, but generally speaking
                                    they were splendidly grounded as regards the production of the basic products -- ore, pig iron, ingots.  This is
                                    sustained by the findings of Woolley and Hunt, JJ., in the court below and by the investigation made by the Bureau
                                    of Corporations.
                                    The preponderant position and the dominance of this combination is manifested by its capital as compared with that
                                    of competitors; its proportion of the total production; its proportion of the total production as compared with that of
                                    each of its principal competitors; its proportion of ore reserves; its control over [****12]  transportation of ore; its
                                    effect upon prices; concerted maintenance of prices under its leadership; and opinion evidence as to its power.
                                    Whilst in our view of the law a combination of able competitors occupying an overwhelmingly preponderant position
                                    in a given trade, such as the combination embodied in the Corporation, unduly restricts competition by its necessary
                                    effect, and therefore is unlawful regardless of purpose, nevertheless it is appropriate to show a wrongful purpose as
                                    a matter of aggravation.  It is elementary, of course, that the purposes of illegal combinations are seldom capable of
                                    proof by direct testimony, but must be inferred from circumstances.  Eastern States Retail Lumber Dealers' Assn. v.
                                    United States, 234 U.S. 600, 612; Reilley v. United States, 106 Fed. Rep. 896; United States v. Sacia, 2 Fed. Rep.
                                    754, 757; Regina v. Murphy, 8 C. & P. 397, 404. The considerations going to show that the controlling purpose of
                                    this super-combination was not the legitimate development of trade, but suppression of competition and exploitation
                                    of the public, are: the form of the combination -- a holding company not itself engaged in trade at [****13]  all; the
                                    union of so many competitors controlling so large a proportion of the trade; the general competitive situation, falling
                                    prices, etc., immediately before the formation of the combination; increase in prices immediately following formation
                                    of the combination; gross overcapitalization of the combination in anticipation of excessive profits; enormous
                                    promoters' profits; cancellation by the combination of contracts for extensions, etc., previously entered into by
                                    constituent companies; and subsequent acquisitions.  (See the findings of Woolley and Hunt, JJ., and of the bureau
                                    of Corporations.)
                                    We are dealing here with a combination of competitors in the truest sense and not with the mere purchase by one
                                    competitor of the business of another as an incident of normal development.  The distinction between a mere
                                    purchase of a competing business and a combination of competing businesses clothed in the form of purchases is
                                    sharply drawn in Shawnee Compress Co. v. Anderson, 209 U.S. 423. See Noyes, Intercorporate Relations, § 354.
                                    If the vast aggregation of competing businesses here involved occupying an overwhelmingly preponderant position
                                    in practically every branch of [****14]  the iron and steel industry had been combined by executory agreement or in
                                    251 U.S. 417, *417; 40 S. Ct. 293, **293; 64 L. Ed. 343, ***343; 1920 U.S. LEXIS 1630, ****9
                                    
                                    
                                    the old form of trust there would be none to dispute the illegality of the transaction.  The legal situation is not
                                    changed by substituting a holding company as the instrument of combination.  The vesting in such a company of
                                    the capital stocks of a group of able competitors for the purpose of centralizing control is no more lawful, is no more
                                    a normal method of business development, than the similar centralization of control in common trustees under the
                                    old form of trust.  In such case, indeed, the holding company is but the old trust in corporate form.  Northern
                                    Securities Co. v. United States, supra; Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 1; Temple Iron Co. v. United
                                    States, 226 U.S. 324; s. c.  183 Fed. Rep. 427. It is literally a case, therefore, of the stockholders of a group of
                                    competing corporations transferring the control of each into the hands of a committee of trustees -- a form of
                                    combination in restraint of trade which has ever been regarded as peculiarly obnoxious.  If competitors controlling
                                    half the trade not alone in one product or in two but in an entire series [****15]  of products constituting one of the
                                    grand divisions of industry may thus combine through a holding company, to what lengths can the process go
                                    without offending the law??  If one-half of the steel industry may be thus combined through one holding company,
                                    certainly those controlling the other half would have the right to combine through another holding company.  And of
                                    course if it be lawful to centralize control of the steel industry in two holding companies it would be equally lawful to
                                    centralize control of every other industry in two holding companies.  Such undue concentration of control over
                                    industry was the very evil which the act was intended to prevent.  United States v. Reading Co., 226 Fed. Rep. 229,
                                    272.
                                    The Corporation is also an instrumentality for uniting and enlarging the power of a group of combinations of
                                    competitive units in particular branches of the iron and steel trade, each in and of itself unlawful.  There is no
                                    likeness between this case and United States v. Winslow, 227 U.S. 202, 217. This case presents a parallel to the
                                    American Tobacco Case, supra, where there was a combination in restraint of trade not in cigarettes alone, nor in
                                    smoking [****16]  tobacco alone, nor in chewing tobacco alone, but in the whole tobacco industry.
                                    This is not a case where the purpose was ""integration."" Integration consists in combining supplementary,
                                    noncompetitive trade units.  An illustrative case is United States v. Winslow, supra. If, therefore, we were successful
                                    in showing that the corporations combined in this case through the holding company are either competitors
                                    themselves or illegal combinations of competitive businesses, the idea of integration is at once excluded. You can
                                    not centralize control of an entire industry by first separately combining competitors in the various branches thereof
                                    and then uniting them in one super-combination and hope to escape the prohibitions of the law by calling what was
                                    done ""integration."" Moreover, the units combined in 1901 through the Corporation were already, for the most part,
                                    highly integrated.  No one, of course, denies the advantage of concentrating under one management the various
                                    stages of steel manufacture from the ore mine to the finishing mill.  This can be done, however, and can be best
                                    done, just as economical size can be attained, without setting up in every branch of trade a combination [****17]  of
                                    competitors with power to exercise substantial dominance over the rest.
                                    The contention that a combination of such size and power was a necessary means to attain efficiency and to
                                    promote foreign trade is irrelevant in law.  It is but another way of saying that good intentions can save the
                                    combination from illegality.  Thomsen v. Cayser, 243 U.S. 66; United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Assn., 166

                                    375, 396. The intent to violate the law implied from doing what the law prohibits renders immaterial every other
                                    intent, purpose, or motive. Bishop, New Criminal Law, § 343; Holmes, The Common Law, p. 52.  Applying this
                                    principle, this court from the very beginning has held that a contract or combination by its own ""inherent nature or
                                    effect,"" without more may ""restrain trade within the purview of the statute."" Any other construction would require
                                    courts to decide not only whether a given combination prevents the existence of effective competition or constitutes
                                    a virtual monopoly, but whether in their opinion monopoly would not be, on the [****18]  whole, a better policy than
                                    competition -- i.e., would compel them to act on frankly legislative grounds.  Park & Sons Co. v. Hartman, 153 Fed.
                                    Rep. 24, 46. Congress rightly believed that the advantages of large business units, in so far as they are real and
                                    substantial, would inevitably assert themselves by normal growth.  It closed the short cut to those advantages --
                                    monopolistic combination -- because danger lies that way.  ""If there is evil in this it is accepted as less than that

                                    combined through this holding company to unite to some extent to develop foreign trade -- by joint selling agencies,
                                    for example -- that can not justify the complete and permanent suppression of competition between them in
                                    domestic trade.  United States v. Corn Products Refining Co., 234 Fed. Rep. 964, 1016; United States v. Union
                                    Pacific  [****19]   R. R. Co., 226 U.S. 61, 93.
                                    The contention that such was the purpose is also unfounded in fact.
                                    As for the contention that competition has increased while the combination's proportion of the trade has decreased,
                                    it is true that as regards the proportion of the trade in steel products possessed by the combination there has been
                                    some decline from the highwater mark reached shortly after its formation, but there has been no such decline as to
                                    curtail the power of the combination.
                                    It is rather the usual thing in such cases for the combination to be able to show some relative decline in its
                                    proportion of the trade.  It was so held with the Standard Oil Company and with the American Tobacco Company.
                                    In fact, it is so uniformly the case as to excite the suspicion that combinations of this character, having found they
                                    can dominate the trade with a smaller proportion of it than they started with, voluntarily yield a part in the belief that
                                    they thereby put themselves in a better position to face the law.  But be this as it may, where, as here, the decline
                                    still leaves the combination in an overwhelmingly preponderant position, it is of no legal consequence whatever.  In
                                    such a case [****20]  the original vice persists and the combination is a ""continually operating force,"" restraining
                                    trade within the meaning of the first section of the act, Standard Oil Co. v. United States, supra; United States v.
                                    Union Pacific R. R. Co., 226 U.S. 61, 96; United States v. Kissel, 218 U.S. 601; and a ""perennial violation of the
                                    second section"" prohibiting monopoly, Standard Oil Co. v. United States, supra, 74; Patterson v. United States, 222
                                    Fed. Rep. 599, 625; United States v. Corn Products Refining Co., 234 Fed. Rep. 964, 1018.
                                    The present bill charges a combination to suppress competition between the parties to the combination themselves.
                                    In such a case the only question is whether the combination embraces competitors in sufficient number and of
                                    sufficient importance to make the resulting restriction of competition a substantial or undue restriction.  Whether
                                    such a combination is also attempting to hinder the competition of those outside the combination is of no weight
                                    except as a matter of aggravation.
                                    The contention that the combination is not unlawful because its power though great is yet not great enough to
                                    enable it alone to [****21]  fix and maintain prices would require a combination of competitors to amount to a
                                    monopoly to fall within the prohibition.  This theory was rejected by this court in the first case under the Anti-Trust
                                    Act which came before it.  United States v. E. C.Knight Co., 156 U.S. 1, 16. To the same effect is the language of
                                    Mr. Justice Day, then a circuit judge, in Chesapeake & Ohio Fuel Co. v. United States, 115 Fed. Rep. 610, 624.
                                    Furthermore, neither the circumstance that the Corporation combined with competitors to maintain the higher prices
                                    established by the combinations whose stocks it acquired, nor that in ten years while increasing its trade
                                    enormously its relative proportion suffered a small decline, justifies the inference that the Corporation could not
                                    have maintained the higher prices by the exertion of its own power alone.  It would be a strange result if the
                                    combination of competitors embodied in the Corporation should escape condemnation because of their illegal
                                    conduct in agreeing upon prices with outside manufacturers.
                                    The contention that the case must fail because the combinations have not increased prices, or limited production, or
                                    degraded the [****22]  quality of product, or decreased wages, or decreased the price of raw materials, or
                                    oppressed competitors, loses sight of the broader policy of the act, which was, not to wait until the evils enumerated
                                    are already upon us, but to prevent their occurrence by striking at their underlying cause -- undue concentration of
                                    commercial power through the process of combination.  The test of the legality of a combination, therefore, is not its
                                    present effect upon prices, wages, etc., nor its present conduct toward the remaining competitors, but its effect
                                    upon competition.  If its effect is unduly to restrict competition, then it is immaterial that for the time being the
                                    combination may exercise its power benevolently.  This defense of good conduct has been interposed in many
                                    cases of this character, and as many times rejected.  Nor is forbearance by a combination from the exercise of its
                                    power to drive the remaining competitors from the field, or to prevent new ones from entering, on any different
                                    footing from good conduct of any other sort.  The cases make no such distinction.  Obviously, where a combination
                                    takes in so large a proportion of the competitors or competitive units that effective [****23]  competition no longer
                                    251 U.S. 417, *417; 40 S. Ct. 293, **293; 64 L. Ed. 343, ***343; 1920 U.S. LEXIS 1630, ****18
                                    
                                    
                                    exists, it can be no defense to say that the combination is doing nothing to prevent the restoration of competitive
                                    conditions.
                                    This contention is based on a construction of the law impracticable in execution.

                                    what the Anti-Trust Act means by ""restraint of trade"": Senator Hoar, Autobiography of Seventy Years, vol. II, p. 364;

                                    Whether, or to what extent, the Standard Oil and Tobacco Cases modify the [****24]  rule laid down by Mr. Justice
                                    Peckham in the Freight Association Case as applicable to public service corporations is not of account in the
                                    present case.  That they do make a distinction between restraint of competition and restraint of trade in the case of
                                    private trading and manufacturing companies, and do hold that as to such companies the restraint of competition in
                                    order to amount to restraint of trade must be undue or unreasonable, is entirely clear, and is recognized in the
                                    subsequent cases.  These cases also hold, as pointed out by Judge Lanning in the Du Pont Case, that whether the
                                    restraint of competition in the case of such companies amounts to restraint of trade must be determined upon the
                                    facts and circumstances of each particular case.
                                    Applying these principles, the direct and necessary effect of the organization of the Steel Corporation was neither to
                                    restrain trade nor create a monopoly, viewed either from the standpoint of competition suppressed or from that of
                                    the extent of control acquired over production or raw materials.  Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 375; United
                                    States v. Standard Oil Co., 173 Fed. Rep. 177, 183; United States [****25]  v. American Tobacco Co., 164 Fed.
                                    Rep. 700, 719; 221 U.S. 157, 182; United States v. Reading Co., 226 U.S. 324, 370.
                                    Notwithstanding the foregoing cases, the Govenment insists that, as a matter of law, the suppression of competition
                                    is undue whenever the combination controls units which together occupy a preponderant position in a given
                                    industry, and this without regard to the intentions of those who form it or the after conduct of the combination.  We
                                    submit that no such test is warranted either by the language of the Anti-Trust Act or by the decisions of this court.
                                    Whether restraint is unreasonable, and therefore undue, is declared in United States v. Terminal Railroad Assn.,
                                    supra, to depend upon three things: (1) the extent of such control; (2) the method by which such control was
                                    brought about; and (3) the manner in which such control has been exercised.  This is but a formulation of the rule
                                    laid down in the Tobacco Case. But we submit that a priori reasoning as to the direct or necessary effect of the
                                    organization of the Steel Corporation or as to the result produced by its preponderant position in the industry, if it
                                    has such a position, is uncalled [****26]  for in the present case.  When the evidence in the case was closed,
                                    thirteen years of the active life of the Corporation had passed. If restraint of trade or monopoly necessarily resulted
                                    from its formation or from its so-called preponderant position in the industry, evidence of such restraint or monopoly
                                    would appear somewhere in its history; and if such evidence does not appear, it is reasonably safe to conclude that
                                    no such result inhered in its organization or position.  That the organization did not so result at any time or as to any
                                    article of steel production, is, we submit, conclusively shown by the testimony in the case, as pointed out in both
                                    opinions of the court below.  And not only is this shown by the testimony, but it is also shown that the Corporation
                                    never acquired the power either to monopolize or to restrain trade.  And this too was found by all the judges of the
                                    court below.
                                    No intent to monopolize or to restrain trade is shown by the circumstances which led up to and surrounded the
                                    organization of the Corporation.  The organization was but a natural and normal development from existing trade
                                    and manufacturing conditions and was only notable because of the largeness [****27]  of the conception which
                                    underlay it and the courage exhibited in undertaking to carry it out.  But ability to think large and courage to execute
                                    251 U.S. 417, *417; 40 S. Ct. 293, **293; 64 L. Ed. 343, ***343; 1920 U.S. LEXIS 1630, ****23
                                    
                                    
                                    the thought are not condemned by the law.  Indeed, the future prosperity of our country must depend in large
                                    measure upon the encouragement given to these attributes of the American business man.
                                    Nor is an intent to monopolize or restrain trade evinced by the after-conduct of the Corporation.  Throughout its
                                    whole career the Corporation has pursued the objects declared by its founders at the time of its formation,
                                    decreasing the cost of production, increasing wages, decreasing prices, and greatly extending trade in steel
                                    products both at home and abroad.  Its treatment of both competitors and consumers has been fair and just; it has
                                    neither attempted to oppress the one nor to coerce the other.  The few plants which it has purchased were offered
                                    to it, and with a single exception they were purchased only because they were needed in the development of the
                                    Corporation's business.  That exception was the plant of the Tennessee Company, and this was purchased with the
                                    approval of the Government for the purpose of preventing the spread of a dangerous [****28]  financial panic.
                                    Instead of promoting pools and combinations, the Corporation destroyed them as early as 1904.  Although the
                                    manufacturers met together from time to time after the breaking up of the pools, they went no further at their
                                    meetings than to mutually exchange information and make declarations of purpose which the petition admits they
                                    had a lawful right to do.  The Gary dinner movement amounted to nothing more than an endeavor to prevent
                                    reckless price-cutting and general demoralization at a time of great industrial peril, and this was sought to be
                                    accomplished simply by an appeal to reason and the establishment of a relation of mutual respect and confidence,
                                    by which it was hoped to secure open and fair dealing and prevent the misunderstandings out of which nearly all
                                    the trade wars of the past had grown.  Instead of monopolizing the manufacture of steel, the Corporation's
                                    percentage of the country's production has steadily decreased; instead of monopolizing the supply of ore, the
                                    Corporation has confined its purchases to two or three localities, and in the locality where its holdings are largest it
                                    has relatively less than many of its competitors and less than its own [****29]  experts and the experts of its
                                    competitors testify that it ought to have.  We respectfully submit that by this record the Corporation has proved the
                                    bona fides of the claim made for it at the time of its organization, that its purpose was the development of a great
                                    business along legitimate and permissible lines, and not monopoly or restraint of trade.  If, however, the
                                    circumstances surrounding the organization left the matter of intent in doubt to be established by the after-conduct
                                    of the parties, we now have such after-conduct extending over the long period of thirteen years, and we submit that
                                    it completely rebuts any presumption (if any there was) of intent to restrain trade or to acquire a monopoly, and as
                                    completely establishes the contrary intent.
                                    Whatever, therefore, may have been the purpose or immediate effect of the organization of the Steel Corporation, it
                                    goes for nothing unless it be found that at the time the petition was filed the Corporation was offending or
                                    threatening to offend against the Anti-Trust Act.  This results from the fact that the action is brought under the third
                                    section of that act which authorizes the Attorney General to institute proceedings [****30]  in equity to prevent or
                                    restrain violations of the act.  The appeal is to the injunctive power of the court which is never exercised to redress
                                    alleged wrongs which have been committed already, but only to restrain those which are still existing or are
                                    threatened.  High on Injunctions, § 23; Pomeroy's Equitable Remedies, vol. I, § 262.
                                    The Corporation had no monopoly and was not restraining trade when the petition was filed, nor was it threatening
                                    to acquire a monopoly or to restrain trade.  It has not the power to do either.
                                    We insist that the acquisition of a preponderant position in a trade or manufacture (whether this means size or
                                    power) without unlawful intent and without excluding practices, does not constitute restraint of trade or monopoly
                                    either at common law or under the Federal Anti-Trust Act when no actual monopoly or actual restraint of trade
                                    results therefrom.  How could it?  Size in itself is nothing as we have already shown.  And power to do wrong
                                    cannot be confounded with wrongdoing itself without leading to hopeless confusion.  We are dealing with a criminal
                                    statute.  If the acquisition of power to violate a statute is the equivalent of its violation, then [****31]  all men are
                                    guilty, for all have acquired the power to violate not one but many statutes.  In the opinions in some of the railroad
                                    cases ( United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Assn., 166 U.S. 290, 334; Northern Securities Co. v. United States,
                                    193 U.S. 197, 373; United States v. Union Pacific R.R. Co., 226 U.S. 61, 88) are to be found expressions to the
                                    effect that it is the scope of combinations of the kind there under consideration and the power to suppress
                                    competition and create monopoly which results therefrom that determines the applicability of the Anti-Trust Act. In
                                    those cases, however, the corporations combining were under a duty to compete, and any substantial suppression
                                    of competition between them was, therefore, illegal -- the scope of the combinations (i. e., what they embraced)
                                    251 U.S. 417, *417; 40 S. Ct. 293, **293; 64 L. Ed. 343, ***343; 1920 U.S. LEXIS 1630, ****27
                                    
                                    
                                    alone determining their illegality.  No such rule has ever been applied to private trading or manufacturing
                                    companies, and this for the obvious reason that such companies are under no duty to compete.  Meredith v.
                                    N.J.Zinc & Iron Co., 55 N.J. Eq. 212, 221. In the Tobacco Case the combination was condemned because the court
                                    thought the conclusion of wrongful [****32]  purposes and illegal combination was overwhelmingly established by
                                    the circumstances surrounding the organization and the after-conduct of the company, showing an ever present
                                    intent to drive competitors out of the field and to monopolize the tobacco trade.  Nothing, we submit, could be more
                                    unreasonable than to condemn every corporation, without regard to its purposes or practices, which happens to
                                    exceed in size or trade power any other competitor in the field.  A rule which would lead to that result, instead of
                                    protecting commerce -- which was the object of the Anti-Trust Act -- would tend to throttle and destroy it by driving
                                    or keeping out of the competitive field all but the incompetents and inefficients.
                                    International Harvester Co. v. Missouri, 234 U.S. 199, was decided under the Missouri statute which prohibited any
                                    combination that lessened or tended to lessen competition.
                                    The elimination of competition between the units combined by the Steel Corporation did not amount to an undue
                                    restriction of competition in the steel trade and so produce a restraint thereof.

                                    The appellees are not accused of fixing prices by contract with competitors, bringing about any deterioration in
                                    product, acquiring additional [****8]  coal deposits since 1890, dismantling or abandoning properties, limiting output,
                                    exclusive or price controlling sales contracts, monopolization of local dealers, espionage over the business of
                                    competitors, partitioning the country into non-competitive districts, discriminating in prices to destroy competitors,
                                    adopting unfair business policies, exacting unreasonable prices, deriving excessive profits from the coal business,
                                    unfair treatment of employees, or unfair treatment of competitors.  Their prices for transportation and for coal have
                                    been reasonable, not excessive, ""monopoly"" prices.
                                    There are in the case three charges: alleged violation of the commodities clause; alleged monopoly in the Schuylkill
                                    region; alleged combination in restraint of trade resulting in the Reading's purchase of control of the Jersey Central.
                                    The tests to be applied to determine whether the Reading Railway Company is violating the commodities clause in
                                    transporting coal owned by the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company at the time of transportation are those
                                    laid down in United States v. Lehigh Valley R.R. Co., 220 U.S. 257, and United States v. Delaware, Lackawanna &
                                    Western R.R.  [****9]   Co., 238 U.S. 516. These tests are also buttressed by the court's declaration of the general
                                    object of the statute to have been to put an end to the carrier's ""opportunity to discriminate in favor of itself against
                                    other shippers in the rate charged, the facility furnished or the quality of the service rendered."" Delaware,
                                    Lackawanna & Western R.R. Co. v. United States, 231 U.S. 363.
                                    The court is not concerned with the question of who ultimately receives the profit from the sale of the commodity,
                                    because it has repeatedly held that the carrier might legally own all of the stock of the corporation which owned the
                                    commodity at the time of transportation and thereby receive all the profits from the sale of the same.  United States
                                    v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U.S. 366, 413, 414.
                                    Furthermore, this court, recognizing the fact that in the legislative progress of the commodities clause in the Senate,
                                    where it originated, an amendment in specific terms providing that the enactment should embrace common
                                    ownership of stock in railroad companies and coal companies by the same stockholders, was rejected (40 Cong.
                                    Rec., pt. 7, pp. 7011-7014), has also unequivocally held that [****10]  such common ownership ""cannot be used as
                                    a test by which to determine the legality of the transportation of such [a coal] company's coal by the interstate
                                    carrier."" United States v. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R.R. Co., 238 U.S. 516, 526.
                                    The Reading Companies were in existence long prior to the time the commodities clause went into effect -- two of
                                    them for 37 years and the third for 12 years.  The Reading Railway has never had any title to coal lands, has never
                                    undertaken any mining operations and has never been engaged in merchandising coal; and the Reading Railway
                                    and the Reading Coal Company have never been parties to any sales agency contract of the kind condemned in
                                    the Lackawanna Case. These factors, which are the converse of those presented in the Lackawanna Case,
                                    differentiate the two cases completely.
                                    The present state of the law places upon the Government the burden of showing, by a preponderance of the proof,
                                    that the affairs of the Railway Company and the Coal Company have been so commingled and the distinctions
                                    between them so obliterated, as to disregard the fact that they were separate juridical beings; cause them to be one
                                    and inseparable,  [****11]  making their affairs indistinguishable; destroy the entity of the Coal Company; and make
                                    it a mere puppet subject to the control of the Railway Company and a mere department thereof.
                                    The origin of the holding of the capital stocks of the Coal Company and the Railway Company by the Reading
                                    Company cannot be treated as a ""mere subterfuge and sham to defeat the commodities clause."" The lower court
                                    was correct in finding that the reorganization was carried out with scrupulous regard for the law, in entire good faith,
                                    and without subterfuge or sham.  It was right in its conclusion that the validity of the charter powers of the Reading
                                    Companies cannot be impeached; that their right to exist cannot be denied; that complete legislative authority to do
                                    the acts they have done cannot be gainsaid, and never has been questioned by the Commonwealth of
                                    Pennsylvania, and that the charters of the three companies gave the undoubted right to issue the securities and
                                    make the conveyances described.
                                    The ownership of railroad equipment by the Reading Company and the lease thereof to the Railway Company have
                                    not been shown to have resulted in giving the latter as a corporation, for its own corporate [****12]  purposes,
                                    253 U.S. 26, *26; 40 S. Ct. 425, **425; 64 L. Ed. 760, ***760; 1920 U.S. LEXIS 1488, ****7
                                    
                                    
                                    ""complete power over the affairs of the Coal Company, as if the Coal Company were a mere department of the
                                    railroad.""
                                    The purchase money mortgage of the Railway Company scrupulously observes the fact that the Railway Company
                                    and the Reading Company are separate juridical beings and in no manner commingles the affairs of the Railway
                                    and Coal Companies so as to cause both such corporations to be one for all purposes.
                                    The general mortgage of the Reading Company does not obliterate the distinctions between the Railway Company
                                    and the Coal Company and cause them to be one and inseparable.
                                    The Government's evidence and arguments on the extent to which the Coal Company and the Railway Company
                                    have officers and offices in common are largely iteration in the past tense of conditions existing more than a decade
                                    ago, not only prior to this court's illuminating decision in 1911 in United States v. Lehigh Valley R.R. Co., 220 U.S.
                                    257, but even before the commodities clause itself went into effect on May 1, 1908.  That evidence is clearly
                                    immaterial and irrelevant as to conditions now existing.  Equitable decrees normally speak in the present tense and
                                    are applied to remedy [****13]  existing evils and not to characterize or condemn past wrongs.  Even in an action
                                    under the Sherman Act an opportunity might well be afforded for a locus poenitentioe.  United States v. Lehigh
                                    Valley R.R. Co., 225 Fed. Rep. 399, 403, 404.
                                    The foregoing facts fully justified the court below in finding that there was a bona fide separate administration of the
                                    affairs of the Coal Company.  United States v. Lehigh Valley R.R. Co., 220 U.S. 257, 274.
                                    Attention is directed to the fact that the two companies employ the same counsel and treasurer, and also have the
                                    majority of directors in common.  Probably no two employees of modern industrial organizations could do less
                                    toward the commingling of the administrative and other affairs of two corporations than the counsel and the
                                    treasurer.  These incidents are of minor importance and do not affect the question of whether the businesses of the
                                    companies are rendered indistinguishable.  That was an issue of fact and the record conclusively establishes that
                                    no such result has followed from the joint employment of these two individuals.  It is repeatedly shown that the
                                    funds and accounts of the two companies are scrupulously [****14]  kept distinct, and there is no evidence whatever
                                    of a commingling of the affairs of the two corporations by their counsel.
                                    The proof of the complete autonomy of the Coal Company and the Railway Company was uncontroverted, and
                                    conclusive.  An excellent summary of the salient features of the testimony appears in Judge McPherson's opinion
                                    below.
                                    In view of the entire autonomy of the three Reading Companies, there is no ground for the contention that the
                                    Railway Company is transporting in interstate commerce anthracite coal mined or produced by it, or under its
                                    authority, or which it owns in whole or in part, or in which it has any interest, direct, or indirect.
                                    As to the alleged monopoly in the Schuylkill Region:
                                    The Government does not raise the issue as to whether the Coal Company in and of itself is a combination in
                                    restraint of interstate commerce or a monopolization thereof.  That company was created May 18, 1871, and by its
                                    charter it was lawful for any railroad company existing under the laws of the State to subscribe for or purchase its
                                    stock, or to purchase or guarantee its bonds.  The corporation then owning the Reading Railroad properties
                                    immediately purchased all the [****15]  stock of the Coal Company.  The latter then immediately set about the
                                    purchase and lease of coal lands, acquiring 80,000 acres before the end of 1872.  By the year 1881 the Coal
                                    Company controlled 98,500 acres of coal land (or slightly in excess of the acreage alleged in the petition).  Shortly
                                    afterwards, in 1885, the stockholders deliberately adopted a policy opposed to all further acquisition.  Thus on the
                                    government theory the close relations alleged to exist between the mining and transportation properties and their
                                    owners have existed for almost half a century (or 20 years before the passage of the Anti-Trust Act); and the Coal
                                    Company's title to its present holdings of coal lands was vested in it almost 40 years ago, or 9 years antecedent to
                                    the passage of that act.  The mining and marketing of coal on the one hand and its transportation on the other are
                                    not competitive businesses.  The court below, with these factors before it, dismissed the petition in respect of this
                                    branch of the case, and this court, on its precedents, we believe, will affirm this action because it holds ""the
                                    disintegration aimed at by the statute does not extend to reducing all manufacture to isolated [****16]  units of the
                                    253 U.S. 26, *26; 40 S. Ct. 425, **425; 64 L. Ed. 760, ***760; 1920 U.S. LEXIS 1488, ****12
                                    
                                    
                                    lowest degree.  The combination was not unlawful so far as it did no more than put the different groups of non-
                                    competing [enterprises] into one control."" United States v. Winslow, 227 U.S. 202, 217, 218.
                                    The Government does not contend that the Coal Company is an unlawful combination or a monopoly, and it cannot
                                    be contended that the transportation is competitive with the mining and marketing; the transportation is intermediate
                                    between the two and supplements them.
                                    This court, like the court below, will be repelled by the consequences of holding with the Government's contentions.
                                    United States v. United Shoe Machinery Co., 247 U.S. 32, 45, 46.
                                    There was no secrecy indicating a guilty plan or conspiracy.  It was all done pursuant to notices to investors all over
                                    the world, in the open, and to meet the financial exigencies of the situation.  The plan was adopted by Edward M.
                                    Paxson, the receiver, who had just resigned as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and the writer
                                    of that court's decision in Commonwealth v. New York, Lake Erie & Western R.R. Co., 132 Pa. St. 591. The
                                    resulting reorganization was declared valid by the [****17]  Attorney General of the Commonwealth, January 2,
                                    1897.  The legality of the plan was approved by eleven eminent counsel.  The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, by
                                    its statutory policy from 1818, had declared to be normal, and affirmatively encouraged, the close inter-relation of
                                    mining, transporting and selling anthracite coal.  (Const. 1874, Art. XVII, § 5, adopted in convention, of which Judge
                                    Dallas was a member.) It was approved by Judge Dallas and Judge Acheson, of the Circuit Court for the Eastern
                                    District of Pennsylvania, contemporaneously with the reorganization.  It was regarded as entirely legal by Judges
                                    Gray, Lanning and Buffington ten years later.  United States v. Reading Co., 183 Fed. Rep. 427, 457, 459, 490. It
                                    was declared to be lawful by Judges McPherson, Hunt and Buffington twenty years later.  United States v. Reading
                                    Co., 226 Fed. Rep. 229, 266-276.
                                    The facts do not indicate monopoly or combination in restraint of trade.  The Coal Company is not charged with
                                    such guilt.  It produces less than 15 per cent. of tonnage.  In the Schuylkill region it has 35 operations and one-half
                                    the tonnage.  Other producers have 53.  On the Reading Railway it does [****18]  not monopolize production or
                                    sales.  Of production it has only 65 per cent.  In sales it must compete with 116 other shippers on 8 other railroads
                                    and 60,000,000 tons of competitive tonnage because the Pennsylvania Railroad reaches every community reached
                                    by the Reading Railway and makes joint rates with every other anthracite railroad.  At tidewater and all distant
                                    points it meets the competition of the entire production.  The court below unanimously supports the foregoing
                                    conclusion.  226 Fed. Rep. 270-271.
                                    The Reading Railway cannot be treated as a monopoly.  Its transportation status in the Schuylkill region has been
                                    practically the same for 50 years.  The Government alleges no acquisition of other carriers there since 1870.  Its
                                    share of total anthracite transportation is less than 19 per cent; the Lehigh Valley Railroad's is greater.  It does not
                                    monopolize the Schuylkill region.  It serves 63 collieries, 11,500,000 tons; other railroads serve 34 collieries,
                                    7,000,000 tons.  It does not monopolize the collieries it serves.  Built in 1833, it has the natural advantages of a
                                    pioneer -- occupation of passes, and possession of best grades.  It serves the region admirably.  It
                                    encounters [****19]  the competition of the total tonnage in all markets as does the Coal Company.
                                    The Reading Company is not a monopoly or combination in restraint of trade.  It merely coordinates and integrates
                                    the non-competitive and complementary businesses of mining, transporting and merchandising anthracite coal,
                                    thereby promoting and stimulating interstate trade and commerce.  No vice exists in including transportation,
                                    because its chief competitors enjoy a like advantage, and government regulations preclude abuse in employing
                                    transportation facilities.
                                    There is no basis for the decree requested by the Government, tearing down an investment of $ 300,000,000, made
                                    originally 50 years ago, when the titles vested, and upon the stability of which investors have justifiably relied for a
                                    generation, -- authorized by state statutes, approved by state officers and courts, reorganized under supervision of
                                    federal courts 23 years ago, and approved unanimously by circuit judges in 1915.
                                    The purchase of the Jersey Central stock was a normal industrial development -- a defensive measure with no
                                    intent to unduly suppress competition.
                                    253 U.S. 26, *26; 40 S. Ct. 425, **425; 64 L. Ed. 760, ***760; 1920 U.S. LEXIS 1488, ****16
                                    
                                    
                                    The railroads combined were not competing in the sense of Mr. Justice [****20]  Day's definition in the Union Pacific
                                    Case.  One was never striving for traffic which the other was seeking to gain.  226 U.S. 87. They did not render
                                    service to the same shipper, id. 87, nor cater to demands of identical patrons.  Id. 88. They were not engaged in the
                                    same carrying trade from the same point of origin to the same destination.  Id. 99. They were, on the contrary,
                                    complementary and supplementary, one to the other, in the sense described in this court's opinion respecting the
                                    form of decree permitting the combination of the Union Pacific and Central Pacific.  If, as a fact, they are thus
                                    supplementary the Government concedes the propriety of their combination.
                                    Even if the Government's theory, that the two roads are competitive because both transport anthracite, be indulged;
                                    nevertheless their unification was valid because ""the extent of the control thereby secured over instrumentalities
                                    which commerce is under compulsion to use,"" under the tests laid down in United States v. St. Louis Terminal, 224
                                    U.S. 383, 394, 395, ""left the competitive conditions in the coal carrying business very slightly affected by the
                                    elimination of competition between [****21]  the Central and the Philadelphia and Reading."" 183 Fed. Rep. 488,
                                    490.
                                    The Government's theory of competition is unsound.  It makes all carriers competitive, and is contrary to the
                                    settlement in the Union Pacific Case. Its theory of competition is impossible of application.  No court can discover
                                    the necessary directness of relationship of cause and effect to enable it to say that the abatement of competition of
                                    such an intangible character necessarily results in a case of unlawful restraint.  This impossibility arises from the
                                    factors of uncertainty, speculation and remoteness, illustrated by the extent of competition of anthracite coal with
                                    other fuels; by the situation in the New England market, where 70,000,000 tons are in potential competition, and
                                    there are numerous uncontrolled rail and water routes, the Reading handling only 3 1/2 per cent. of the potential
                                    supply; and by similar conditions at New York and elsewhere -- even on the Reading Railway itself.
                                    But even according to the government theory, competition was unaffected.  The Central did not reach the Reading
                                    territory, and competition was continued by eight other lines in close proximity to the Central and Reading.  [****22]
                                    See 183 Fed. Rep. 457, 488, 490. The vital question is not the amount of competition suppressed, but the amount
                                    remaining.  If, as here, the competitors remaining are numerous, large, and powerful the restriction of competition
                                    cannot be deemed undue.  The issue is one of fact and not of law and must be decided on the evidence, not on
                                    theory or speculation.  The evidence covering the period since 1901 when this combination was formed shows the
                                    facts to be that the Reading's powerful competitors have increased their anthracite traffic by much greater
                                    percentages than has the Reading; that any diminution of the Reading's service to the public or attempted restraint
                                    on interstate trade would be frustrated immediately by the preponderant competitive power of its eight powerful
                                    rivals; that the public has been benefited for any loss of competition resulting from the combination by the more
                                    than compensating advantage derived from the upbuilding of the half dozen through routes for freight and
                                    passenger traffic competing with the Pennsylvania Railroad.  This court would not be justified in destroying these
                                    routes and their advantage to the public merely to guard against a speculative possibility [****23]  of injury which the
                                    evidence shows cannot ensue.  In view of its decision in the St. Louis Terminal Case, this court should hold the
                                    lower court's view of the evidence, -- considering the lessons of the war as to what restrains trade, the joint
                                    operation of railroads, and the provisions of impending railroad legislation.
                                    As for the Coal Companies, the Reading Company's influence over the Wilkes-Barre Company was only incidental
                                    and negligible.  There is no evidence of a motive to control production.  Competition was practically unaffected, and
                                    the management of the two companies was not amalgamated.
                                    The Reading Company did not create a monopoly or combination in restraint of the anthracite trade in 1901.  The
                                    trade as a whole has expanded; the number of employees, their employment and earnings have increased; and
                                    production has kept pace with population.
                                    The Reading did not acquire in 1901 sufficient power to monopolize or restrain the trade had it sought to do so.
                                    The combined business of the two coal companies was then only one-fourth of the total business, and in the interim
                                    has shrunk until now it is only one-fifth.  It does not now possess the power to monopolize or [****24]  restrain the
                                    trade even if it wished to do so.
                                    253 U.S. 26, *26; 40 S. Ct. 425, **425; 64 L. Ed. 760, ***760; 1920 U.S. LEXIS 1488, ****19
                                    
                                    
                                    If the Government's most extravagant contention had been sustained by proof, their criticism of the coal land
                                    holdings makes no case presently calling for the interposition of the action of this court.  It will be time enough to
                                    destroy such a monopoly when it appears and when it has gained power to injure the public.  Now the court should
                                    deal only with the present actualities.  By the time that such a monopoly arises, if it ever does, it may be that the
                                    public policy will foster it, or we may have a nationalization of all mines.
                                    Finally, the Government's contentions now are inconsistent with its attitude in the Harvester Case.  On November 2,
                                    1918, the Department of Justice consented to a decree in that case in and by which, in order to ""restore competitive
                                    conditions and bring about a situation in harmony with law,"" the company was only required to sell such of its lines
                                    of harvesting machines as would leave it at least 66 per cent. of the industry."

                                    Rawls were on the briefs, for [****2]  plaintiff in error.
                                    Defendants are voluntary associations and corporations engaged upon a vast scale, involving the investment of
                                    millions of dollars, in the business of providing, by the transportation from State to State of baseball teams and their
                                    necessary attendants and equipment, exhibitions of professional baseball.  The court is not concerned with whether
                                    the mere playing of baseball, that is the act of the individual player, upon a baseball field in a particular city, is by
                                    itself interstate commerce.  That act, it is true, is related to the business of the defendants, but it can no more be
                                    said to be the business than can any other single act in any other business forming a part of interstate commerce.
                                    The question with which the court is here concerned is whether the business in which the defendants were engaged
                                    when the wrongs complained of occurred, taken as an entirety, was interstate commerce, or more accurately,
                                    whether the monopoly which they had established or attempted to establish was a monopoly of any part of
                                    interstate commerce.
                                    At the foundation of the business of one of these leagues -- in its primary conception -- is a circuit embracing seven
                                    different [****3]  States.  No single club in that circuit could operate without the other members of the circuit, and
                                    accordingly in the very beginning of its business the matter of interstate relationship is not only important but
                                    predominant and indispensable.
                                    Each game symbolizes a contest of skill between the two cities that have been brought together by means of
                                    interstate communication and travel.  Each team of each club in the league carries with it, and it is essential to the
                                    profit of the enterprise that it should carry with it, its representative character; it symbolizes the great city that it
                                    represents to those assembled to witness the contest.
                                    259 U.S. 200, *200; 42 S. Ct. 465, **465; 66 L. Ed. 898, ***898; 1922 U.S. LEXIS 2475, ****1
                                    
                                    
                                    In addition to this representative city and state aspect, there is also the element of intersectional rivalry.  Experience
                                    has shown that the game is most largely patronized when clubs are so located as to provide a contest for
                                    supremacy between the Eastern and Western sections of the country.
                                    It is necessary to distinguish between baseball as a sport, that is, where it is played merely as a means of physical
                                    exercise and diversion, and this business of providing exhibitions of professional baseball.  The business of
                                    Organized Baseball represents [****4]  and has represented for many years, an investment of colossal wealth.
                                    Defendants who dominate Organized Baseball are not engaged in a sport.They are engaged in a money-making
                                    business enterprise in which all of the features of any large commercial undertaking are to be found.When the
                                    teams of the National or American Leagues or of any other league are sent around the circuit of the league, they go
                                    at the direction of employers whose business it is to send them, and whose profits are made as a result of that
                                    business operation.
                                    When the profit-making aspect of the business is examined, it will be found that the interstate element is still further
                                    magnified.  The vast investment of capital which has been made in it is required, among other things, in ofder to
                                    provide a place at which the teams in the league may play their contests.  Each club has a ball park, with stands
                                    erected upon them, sometimes, as in the case of a major league club, costing several millions of dollars.  Every
                                    club in the league earns its profit not only by the drawing capacity of its team at home, but also by that of the teams
                                    of the clubs which its team visits in the various cities in the league.  The gate [****5]  receipts in all of the cities in
                                    which the clubs are located are divided according to a definite proportion, fixed by agreement between the club of
                                    the city in which the game is played and the club employing the visiting team.
                                    In no other business that can now be recalled is there such a close interrelationship and interdependence between
                                    persons in one State and persons in another.  The personality, so to speak, of each club in a league is actually
                                    projected over state lines and becomes mingled with that of the clubs in all the other States.  The continuous
                                    interstate activity of each is essential to all the others.  The clubs of each league constitute a business unit
                                    embracing territorially a number of different States.  While each club has, of course, a local legal habitat, yet from a
                                    practical business standpoint it is primarily an ambulatory organization.
                                    It is difficult to perceive the relevancy of any discussion about an article of commerce in this case.  Commerce may
                                    be carried on in one of its forms by traffic in articles of merchandise, but there are countless forms in which it may
                                    be carried on without traffic in such articles.  Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 189.
                                    It is [****6]  also difficult to discern the relevancy of the contention that personal effort is not an article of commerce.
                                    Personal effort, while it may not be an article of commerce, is often commerce itself, but we are not concerned with
                                    any such question here.  It may be passed by saying taht it has been adjudicated by this court in the Hoke Case,
                                    227 U.S. 308, that interstate commerce may be created by the mere act of a person in allowing himself to be
                                    transported from one State to another, without any personal effort; and further that it is very difficult to see how
                                    International Textbook Co. v. Pigg, 217 U.S. 91, could have been decided as it was, except upon the principle that
                                    the mere exchange of instruction and information, which is about as purely a matter of personal effort as anything
                                    that can be imagined, may be a subject of interstate commerce.
                                    If transactions in interstate commerce were to be judged by their isolated ultimate results, as the defendants seek to
                                    separate the act of a player in throwing a ball upon a ball field from all the steps which are taken to bring the ball
                                    player in the due course of business from other States, of course their interstate character could be [****7]
                                    plausibly argued away.  By such a process of reasoning the American Tobacco Company, for instance, might have
                                    removed its gigantic monopoly from the operation of the Sherman Act.  See United States v. American Tobacco
                                    Co., 221 U.S. 106, 184; Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 68; Swift & Co v. United States, 196 U.S.
                                    375.
                                    In the business now under consideration throughout the playing season the ball teams, their attendants and
                                    paraphernalia, are in constant revolution around a preestablished circuit.  Their movement is only interrupted to the
                                    extent of permitting exhibitions of baseball to be given in the various cities.  When exhibitions in one city are
                                    completed the clubs resume, according to the agreement made, and plan of business long established, their course
                                    of travel on to another city, and thus on and on until the schedule of exhibitions is completed.  The interruption in

                                    interstate movement is nothing like as great as that in the Swift Case, supra. The constant movement of the teams
                                    from State to State during a period of over five months each year, is under a single direction and control and in
                                    pursuance of one object.
                                    See Champion v. Ames, 188 U.S. 321; Pensacola [****8]  Telegraph Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 96 U.S.

                                    presented as to whether a company engaged in booking vaudeville performers for a circuit embracing theatres in
                                    cities in different States was engaged in interstate commerce within the Sherman Act.  Also, Motion Picture Patents

                                    It is common knowledge that baseball is the preeminent American sport.  Millions of people follow the daily reports
                                    of the results of the games in the press, and in the large cities gather in the afternoons around the newspaper
                                    offices to see the bulletin reports of the scores.  Not only so, but vast numbers of people travel from one city to
                                    another for the purpose of witnessing the games.  Telegraph facilities are installed at all the ball parks in the Major
                                    Leagues, and in those of the more important Minor Leagues, where reports of the games are sent out and are
                                    received throughout the country.
                                    Each league contracts for a uniform type of baseball,  [****9]  which is used in tremendous numbers and shipped by
                                    the manufacturer from time to time as they are needed by the various clubs.
                                    These incidents, while in themselves not determinative of the question of whether or not the business is interstate in
                                    character, yet, when considered in connection with its main features, emphasize the truth of what has before been
                                    said, that there is scarcely any business which can be named in which the element of interstate commerce is as
                                    predominant as that in which defendants are engaged.
                                    The agreement and combination entered into and maintained by defendants whereby the entire business in the
                                    United States of providing exhibitions of professional baseball was brought under the control of defendants and
                                    their confederates in Organized Baseball, amounted in law to a conspiracy in restraint of trade among the several
                                    States and a monopoly or an attempt to monopolize a part of commerce among the several States within the
                                    meaning of the Sherman Act.
                                    There is no testimony in this case legally sufficient to show that the plaintiff has waived its right to recover damages
                                    under the Sherman Act.
                                    Mr. George Wharton Pepper, with whom Mr. Benjamin S. Minor [****10]  and Mr. Samuel M. Clement, Jr., were on
                                    the brief, for defendants in error.
                                    Organized Baseball is not interstate commerce and does not constitute an attempt to monopolize within the
                                    Sherman Act.
                                    Personal effort, not related to production, is not a subject of commerce; and the attempt to secure all the skilled
                                    service needed for professional baseball contests is not an attempt to monopolize commerce or any part of it.
                                    Clayton Act, § 6; Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168; Hooper v. California, 155 U.S. 648; Metropolitan Opera Co. v.
                                    Hammerstein, 147 N.Y.S. 532; In re Duff, 4 Fed. 519; In re Oriental Society, 104 Fed. 975; People v. Klaw, 106
                                    N.Y.S. 341. The Department of Justice has ruled that the business conducted by Organized Baseball was not in
                                    violation of the Sherman Act; and also that the business of presenting theatrical entertainments is not commerce.
                                    Distinguishing: International Textbook Co. v. Pigg, 217 U.S. 91; and Marienelli v. United Booking Offices, 227 Fed.
                                    165. The only case in which the question whether Organized Baseball is within the Sherman Act has been directly
                                    passed upon is that of American Baseball Club of Chicago v. Chase, 149 N.Y.S. 6; in which the court [****11]
                                    answered the question in the negative.
                                    Congress has not imposed a penalty upon the transportation of players for baseball purposes, and therefore Hoke
                                    v. United States, 227 U.S. 308, is not point.  While Congress may regulate the movement of persons in interstate
                                    commerce, when it has not regulated movement as such, the doing of an act essentially local is not converted into
                                    an interstate act merely because people came from another State to do it.

                                    Pending the trial of an action, the court has power, upon such terms as may be just, to permit a second amended
                                    complaint to be filed, which embodies substantially the same allegations as the original complaint. ( Riverside Land
                                    Co. v. Jensen, 73 Cal. 550, 15 P. 131.)
                                    Where the facts stated in the complaint constitute a sufficient cause of action, other unnecessary matter may be
                                    stricken, but an entire pleading cannot be stricken out as irrelevant or redundant. ( Benedict v. Dake, 6 How. Pr. (N.
                                    Y.) 352; Jackson v. Lebar, 53 Cal. 255.)
                                    C.S., secs. 2531 and 2532, describe the scope of the act, and this action being for damages to the plaintiff by
                                    reason of the violation of the act by the defendant, it is only necessary to support an action under the act that
                                    complainant's business or property has in some way been injured by reason of defendant's illegal scheme. (
                                    Monarch Tobacco Co. v. American Tobacco Co., 165 F. 774.)
                                    
                                    
                                    Plaintiff [***2]  must be given liberal latitude under the act. ( Ware Kreamer Tobacco Co. v. American Tobacco Co.,
                                    178 F. 117; Buckeye Powder Co. v. Dupont Powder Co., 196 F. 514.)
                                    The contracts, combinations, etc., in restraint of trade or commerce which are declared to be illegal by the act,
                                    include all contracts, etc., operating to restrain trade or commerce whether legal or illegal at common law or
                                    whether the restraint is reasonable or unreasonable. ( United States v. Trans-Missouri F. Assn., 166 U.S. 290, 17 S.

                                    The system and scheme established and put in force by the defendants controlled the entire issue of stock in the
                                    Monumental Mercury Mining Company, and is necessarily a general restraint of trade in the stock of said
                                    corporation and therefore illegal. ( Oliver v. Gidmore, 52 F. 562; Miles Medical Co. v. John Parks & Son, 220 U.S.
                                    373, 31 S. Ct. 376, 55 L. Ed. 502.)
                                    The second amended complaint stated a cause of action under the law and the court had no right to strike it from
                                    the files by reason of any pleading, motion or suggestions made by the respondents. They not having filed a
                                    demurrer,  [***3]  the complaint to be had must be wholly insufficient; if to any extent, on any reasonable theory, it
                                    presents facts sufficient to justify a recovery, it will be sustained. (21 R. C. L. 466.)

                                    The pooling of stock is not unlawful. ( Weber v. Della Mountain Mining Co., 14 Idaho 404, 94 P. 441.)
                                    Under the anti-trust act it is not sufficient to frame the declaration in the words of the statute, but it is essential that
                                    the substance of the contract in restraint of trade or the substantial facts which constitute the attempt to monopolize
                                    should be set forth therein. ( Cilley v. United Shoe Machine Co., 152 F. 726.)
                                    Under the statute, in order to recover damages, a plaintiff must have been injured in his person or property and the
                                    injury sustained must be charged in the complaint by proper averment. ( Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., 162 F.

                                    The question raised is whether the contract as sued on was ""In violation of the provisions of chapter 88 and chapter
                                    119 of the Laws of Mississippi, 1908, on trusts and combines, and particularly in violation of sections 3281-3283,
                                    Hemingway's Code as contrary to the public policy of the state of Mississippi.""
                                    I. The appellant's contention is that the contract here sued on is in violation of the provisions of the Anti-Trust
                                    Statutes, as shown by the terms of said contract, and expressed in the following language: ""The quantity of 'Royal
                                    Cement' mentioned on the reverse side hereof is sold and delivered for use in the work described, and if buyer shall
                                    sell or otherwise dispose of any portion of said cement, or use any portion thereof in any work other than that
                                    described, or assign this contract or any part thereof, or fail to comply with the terms of payment, or any of the
                                    conditions and limitations of this contract, or if the [***2]  buyer's credit becomes impaired, then in any such event or
                                    events, seller may, at his option, decline to make further deliveries hereunder, buyer remaining liable for all unpaid
                                    accounts.""
                                    If such a contract as this is not in restraint of trade; if it does not hinder and prevent the selling and exchanging of
                                    personal property, or an article or commodity of trade that is in every day use, and in this day a necessary and
                                    indispensable article of commerce, we are at a loss to understand what kind of an agreement or contract would be
                                    in restraint of trade. If said contract, we submit in candor and frankness, is not for the fixing, maintaining and
                                    restricting of prices unlawfully and arbitrarily, we cannot conceive of one that would be. 24 R. C. L., sec. 655, page

                                    Under the common law and the expressed terms of the statute and under the decisions cited above, as to the
                                    construction and applicability, it is manifest that the contract here sued on is within the rule as announced by the
                                    common law, and in violation of the anti-trust statute. It is in violation of each of the sub-divisions of the statute
                                    enumerated in the demurrer. It is in restraint of trade in that it requires the public work to be constructed with but
                                    one specified brand of cement, furnished by a specified person and from a specified manufacturer, and prohibits the
                                    appellant from procuring cement of equal quality from other sources than through the buyer, the appellee herein,
                                    even though the shipper, the Dixie-Portland Cement Company, could [***4]  not supply same according to the
                                    requirements of appellant, whereby the public work would suffer and the business of the county and the appellant.
                                    As further authorities on this point, see Universal Film Co. v. Copperman, 218 F. 577, and Waltham Watch Co. v.
                                    Keene, 212 F. 225.
                                    II. It is stipulated in the contract that the cement should be furnished by the Dixie Portland Cement Company,
                                    subject to contingencies of manufacturing and shipping and other causes beyond control of shipper and seller, and
                                    cement to be delivered as nearly as practicable to meet the necessities of the work upon reasonable notice of time
                                    for deliveries; and that shipments are to be at ""the market price of Royal cement at the date of shipment."" ""But not
                                    higher than the price named therein;"" that prices quoted are ""based on freight rates in effect on date of quotation
                                    and are subject to revision if freight rates are changed.""
                                    In Hart v. Gardner, 74 Miss. 153, 20 So. 877, it is stated that the purpose of all rules of construction is to effect the
                                    intention of the parties to the instrument. In Wall v. DeJet, 76 Miss. 104, 23 So. 437, it is held that it is the duty of
                                    the court in construing a contract to [***5]  place itself in the situation of the parties at the time the contract was
                                    made, and to ascertain their intention from the contract, in the light of the situation and looking also to the subject-
                                    matter. See also Pratt v. Canton Cotton Oil Co., 51 Miss. 470; Tufts v. Greenwald, 66 Miss. 360, 6 So. 156.
                                    Manifestly the intention of the parties was that the market price of the cement to be shipped under the contract
                                    would be such as would prevail at the plant of the Dixie Portland Cement Company, the point of shipment, plus
                                    freight to the point of delivery. It is in the testimony and undisputed that the price of Royal Cement in New Orleans,
                                    La., at the time that appellant refused to accept cement from the appellee, was two dollars and eighty-two cents per
                                    barrel, and that said cement was shipped from the point of manufacture, a point near Chattanooga, Tenn., to New
                                    Orleans, by way of the Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., through the very points or by the very stations where three
                                    dollars and thirty cents and later three dollars and twenty cents per barrel was demanded.
                                    It is further shown by the undisputed testimony of the appellant that he did go into the open market and buy [***6]
                                    cement of a quality and grade equal to the Royal Cement for the price of two dollars and eighty-two cents per
                                    barrel, delivered at the points called for in the contract, and that the price of two dollars and eighty-two cents which
                                    the appellant paid for the cement delivered to him at points mentioned in the contract here sued on was the same
                                    price that prevailed at New Orleans, for the cement. 16 Cyc. 1143. See Paxton v. Myer, Weis & Company, 58 Miss.
                                    445.
                                    If, however, we should be in error in our contention that ""market price"" in this case is price at the manufactory plus
                                    freight to the point of delivery, then we earnestly beg to submit that the determination of ""market price"" of Royal
                                    Cement at points of delivery is not to be settled by the arbitrary fiat of the Dixie Portland Cement Company to its
                                    exclusive dealer, Delmas, but by what was its market value. That is to say, when ""market price"" is not discoverable
                                    by proof of free sales of the commodity in the open market, then its ""market value,"" if discoverable, becomes its
                                    ""market price."" See especially McGarry v. Superior Portland Cement Company, et al. (1917), 95 Wash. 412, 163 P.
                                    928, American and English Annotated Cases,  [***7]  Vo. 1918A, p. 578 and note. This case holds that justice can
                                    be done only by interpreting the phrase. in this contract, ""market price,"" by its true meaning, which is ""market
                                    value,"" the facts of the case considered.
                                    It is our contention, therefore, that the term ""market price"" used in the Delmas-Gano contract was not in the
                                    intention of the parties and cannot be held in law, a price such as the manufacturers chose to maintain at the points
                                    140 Miss. 323, *323; 105 So. 535, **535; 1925 Miss. LEXIS 265, ***3
                                    
                                    
                                    mentioned in the contract, under a contract already made by his exclusive dealer, and with which the manufacturer
                                    was familiar; but was intended by the parties, and will be held in law, to be the price such as that quality of cement
                                    could actually be purchased and delivered for. This view is fully sustained by a note to the foregoing case, in Ann.
                                    Cas. 1918 A at 575.
                                    We now sum up our contentions, as follows: The demurrer should have been sustained, holding that the contract
                                    was in restraint of trade in violation of the statutes of Mississippi and the Sherman Anti-Trust Law; or the contract
                                    had been breached by the plaintiff in that he refused to reduce the price of Royal Cement to keep pace with the
                                    reduction of cements of similar quality.  [***8]  Wherefore, we submit that the judgment of the lower court should be
                                    reversed, and this case dismissed.
                                    White & Ford, for appellee.
                                    The question presented is whether Delmas is entitled to recover profits he would have made had the contract been
                                    carried out. The proof fixed it at ten cents per barrel. The authorities generally hold that profits may be recovered
                                    where definite. Delta, etc., v. Yazoo, etc., 105 Miss. 861; Ice Company v. Holliday, 106 Miss. 714; Stevenson v.
                                    Morris, 69 Miss. 234.
                                    While our friends on the other side have cited no case holding or tending to hold that Delmas' contract with Gano
                                    would have been met by his furnishing cement other than Royal, yet that was one of the principal contentions in the
                                    court below, and out of an abundance of precaution, we cite a few cases showing the fallacy of this contention.
                                    Shackelford v. Sloss Iron & Steel Co., 36 So. 1005, 140 Ala. 329; Daggy v. Cox, 19 Ind. 142; Hiatt v. Harris, 28 Ind.
                                    379; King v. City of Rochester, 38 A. 256, 67 N. H. 310; Lowry v. Cooper, 21 Ind. 269; Clark v. Wright, 5 Phila. 432.
                                    Looking at the contract to get the intention of the parties as to what market price was contemplated,
                                    manifestly [***9]  market price at points of delivery was intended. There is nothing whatever in the contract to
                                    warrant the conclusion that New Orleans price was thought of. Furthermore, Gano knew how and where Delmas
                                    was to get his supply of cement, because the contract between them gave notice that Delmas had a contract with
                                    the Dixie Portland Cement Company for the furnishing of the contract supply, and this contract is also in evidence.
                                    The law on market price in a case of this sort is clear, and the following may be noted: Gray Harbor v. Turnbull, 163

                                    Applying the reasoning of the above cases to the facts here, we find that in the testimony of Delmas that Royal
                                    cement was sold at Pascagoula to other persons other than Gano at the same price that Gano was charged, and,
                                    furthermore, that this commodity was largely used at Pascagoula, other cements having been sold there, as well as
                                    Royal. Manifestly, the New Orleans price was not thought of, as it is not mentioned in the contract. Even if Delmas
                                    had sought to obtain his supply of Royal cement in New Orleans, the proof is that it would have cost [***10]  him
                                    about two dollars and eighty-two cents plus forty cents freight to Pascagoula, and this would have been in line with
                                    the price that Gano charged. It follows from the foregoing, we submit, that Delmas' right to recover was abundantly
                                    clear. The contract must be enforced as the parties made it.
                                    Defendant complains of what he conceives to be monopolistic or trust features of the contract. While there has
                                    been much loose talk about the provisions of the state and federal anti-trust laws, fortunately the courts have set at
                                    rest some of the leading phases of the subject. The authorities generally hold that a contract is not invalidated,
                                    which is in reasonable restraint of trade. In Houck v. Wright, 77 Miss. 476, this court held that a wholesaler can
                                    confine his sale of goods to one dealer in any given territory, and not thereby violate the antitrust law. The Dixie
                                    Portland Cement Company had the right to select Delmas as its exclusive dealer in Jackson county territory,
                                    according to that decision. In Telephone Co. v. State, 100 Miss. 102, the court held: ""That contracts in reasonable
                                    restraint of trade are valid, and are not void unless unreasonable and inimical to public welfare.  [***11]  ""
                                    The same is held in Brown v. Staple Cotton Oil Co., 132 Miss. 859. The supreme court of the United States has
                                    frequently passed on this anti-trust question. While authorities might be multiplied, the following cases dispose of
                                    the contentions made by appellant in this regard: United States v. Colgate & Co., 63 L. Ed. 993; United States v.
                                    Schrader, 64 L. Ed. 471; R. R. v. Pullman Car Co., 35 L. Ed. 97, 139 U.S. Sup. Court Rep. 79.
                                    140 Miss. 323, *323; 105 So. 535, **535; 1925 Miss. LEXIS 265, ***7
                                    
                                    
                                    In Cotton Oil Co. v. State, 121 Miss. 615, the court held that it was not unlawful for a ginning company to attempt to
                                    destroy competition by putting the price of ginning cotton below the actual cost. There is nothing invalid about the
                                    contract here."

                                    To have justified consideration of the questions of waiver and estoppel by the jury in this case when it was
                                    submitted there should have been evidence of at least three of the essential elements of waiver and estoppel, upon
                                    which such evidence was completely lacking, viz.: An intention of the plaintiff to relinquish or waive the clause on
                                    credit violation, reliance by the defendant upon the waiver and alteration of its position, and the passing from the
                                    defendant to the plaintiff of some valuable consideration for it. (27 R. C. L. 904, 908, sec. 5; Idaho Grimm Alfalfa

                                    Waiver may be made by an express agreement or promise declaring an intention not to claim the supposed benefit
                                    or advantage, and such agreement or declaration will not only waive those matters coming expressly within its
                                    terms, but will extend to other matters which by a natural and necessary implication would be affected.
                                    The more usual manner of waiving a right is by conduct or acts which indicate an intention to relinquish the right, or
                                    by such failure to insist upon it that the party is estopped to afterwards set it up against his adversary. (40 Cyc.
                                    [***3]  265.)
                                    Intent to waive can be constructive as well as actual. ( Somers v. Germania Nat. Bank, 152 Wis. 210, 138 N. W.
                                    713.)
                                    In determining whether a given contract contravenes public policy, the test is not always nor necessarily what acts
                                    the parties performed or contemplated in order to fulfill their agreement or its actual result, but rather whether its
                                    tendency is evil. ( Oliver v. Wilder, 27 Colo. App. 337, 149 P. 275.)
                                    Every contract, combination or agreement whose direct purpose, probable effect or necessary tendency is to stifle
                                    or unduly restrict competition is unlawful by common law and by statute. (19 R. C. L. 36, sec. 20.)
                                    The test is the evil tendency of the contract and not its actual injury to the public in a particualr case.
                                    And agreements whose tendency is to establish a monopoly are void although they may not in the particular case
                                    destroy competition or enhance prices. (13 C. J. 425; Russell v. Courier Printing & Pub. Co., 43 Colo. 321, 95 P.

                                    At the conclusion of the court's charge to the jury, the court said at the bench to counsel:
                                    'I think it might be understood for the record that all objections and exceptions heretofore taken by respective

                                    have the same force and effect as if repeated on the grounds heretofore given.'

                                    Counsel for appellants then stated other and further objections to the instructions given and refused.
                                    The procedure shown above is substantially that often used by district judges in their compliance with Rule 30.  It
                                    saves time. It is generally acceptable to counsel and opportunity  [**19]  is given for further objections, in addition to
                                    those previously made and incorporated by reference.
                                    Ziegler v. U.S., 9 Cir., 1949, 174 F.2d 439, 448, certiorari denied 338 U.S. 822, 70 S.Ct. 68, 94 L.Ed. 499, first cast
                                    a possible doubt on this procedure.  In that case the trial court, before giving the instructions, informed counsel of its
                                    proposed action but no objection was made by defendant.  The court on appeal,  [*745]  however, used language
                                    inferring that objections made 'before the charge was given' was not a compliance with Rule 30.
                                    Later in Remmer v. U.S., 9 Cir., 1953, 205 F.2d 277, the same circuit distinguished the Ziegler case in Note 16,
                                    page 290, and approved the same procedure followed in the instant case.
                                    We do not regard Kobey v. United States, 9 Cir., 1953, 208 F.2d 583 as disapproving the procedure followed in the
                                    instant case, or as overruling the Remmer case.  In the Kobey case there was not an arranged procedure for
                                    incorporation by reference but merely a general, all-inclusive objection.  The cases cited in footnote 3 of the Kobey
                                    case are good law to the effect that objection must be made to instructions and that a general objection is not good
                                    but  [**20]  that the objection must be specific.  The Remmer case is not cited.
                                    210 F.2d 732, *744; 1954 U.S. App. LEXIS 4297, **16
                                    
                                    
                                    We consider the Remmer case as expressly approving the procedure followed in the trial of the instant case, and

                                    (B) Rule 18(2) (d) of this Court.
                                    Appellants have failed to comply with Rule 18(2) (d) of this court in presenting the instruction problem in their brief.

                                    ] The rule requires 'when the error alleged is to the charge of the court, the specification shall set out the
                                    part referred to totidem verbis, whether it be instructions given of in instructions refused, together with the grounds
                                    of the objections urged at the trial.'
                                    Reference by summary and number is made by appellant to certain instruction.  The grounds of objection we find
                                    only by a search of the record.  Some of the instructions complained of were not objected to before the trial court
                                    and in the case of others, the objections stated to the trial judge were meaningless and of no assistance to that
                                    court.
                                    (C) The Instructions.
                                    However, we proceed to examine the instructions.  We have already held the commerce allegations of the
                                    indictment sufficient as alleging the  [**21]  commission of acts which unreasonably restrained that commerce either
                                    under the 'in' or the 'affect' commerce theory.
                                    Government counsel apparently thought he was proceeding on two alternative theories at the trial:- First, that the
                                    proof would show, that the plumbing contractors were 'conduits' and that there was a continuous and uninterrupted
                                    flow of plumbing supplies in interstate commerce from out of state into southern Nevada to their place of use or
                                    installation, and that the acts complained of unreasonably restricted the flow of such commerce. Second, and
                                    alternatively, that even if the interstate commerce ended with the plumbing contractor and if the activities of the
                                    plumbing contractors complained of were purely intrastate activities, nevertheless their activities unreasonably and
                                    substantially affected the flow of interstate commerce. The government asks us to sustain the conviction on both
                                    grounds.
                                    As to whether both theories are available in support of the conviction we shall now see.
                                    The 'in' commerce theory
                                    The court properly left to the jury the questions as to whether the flow of materials was from out of state, and was
                                    through the conduit of the plumbing contractors  [**22]  and was in commerce, and whether the appellants agreed
                                    to fix prices or allocate jobs.
                                    Instruction 25 reads, in part:
                                    'The indictment alleges that there exists a flow of commerce from manufacturers of plumbing and  [*746]  heating
                                    supplies located outside of Nevada to their place of installation and use in buildings in southern Nevada and that
                                    the plumbing contractors are conduits through which these supplies manufactured and shipped from other states
                                    are sold and distributed to the consuming public in southern Nevada.  It is for you to decide whether this allegation
                                    is true beyond a reasonable doubt. * * *'
                                    Instruction 23 reads, in part:
                                    'In order to violate the Sherman Act, the activities of the defendants must affect commodities which move in
                                    interstate commerce. I charge you that if you find that the trade and commerce in plumbing and heating supplies is
                                    as alleged in the indictment, and if you further find that defendants agreed to fix the prices to be used by plumbing
                                    6.  The court in the Ziegler case consisted of Mathews, Stephens, and Driver (District Judge).  The court in the Remmer case
                                    consisted of Mathews, Stephens and Orr.  The court in the Kobey case consisted of Mathews, Orr and Lemmon (District Judge).

                                    contractors in submitting bids for the sale and installation of such supplies or that they agreed upon a particular
                                    contractor to furnish such supplies on a specific job, then violation of the Sherman Act  [**23]  has been
                                    established. * * *'
                                    While instructions refused are not asserted as error except by listing the numbers, we have examined them as they
                                    apply to this aspect of the case, and find no error.
                                    The 'affect' commerce theory

                                    ] 'The injury, and hence the power, (to regulate intrastate transactions) does not depend upon the
                                    fortuitous circumstance that the particular person conducting the intrastate activities is, or is not, also engaged in
                                    interstate commerce.' U.S. v. Wrightwood Dairy Co., 1942, 315 U.S. 110, 121, 62 S.Ct. 523, 527, 86 L.Ed. 726 (our
                                    insertion).  'If it is interstate commerce that feels the pinch, it does not matter how local the operation which applies
                                    the squeeze.' U.S. v. Women's Sportswear Manufacturers Ass'n, 1949, 336 U.S. 460, 464, 69 S.Ct. 714, 716, 93
                                    L.Ed 805.
                                    There are several instructions which squint at the 'affect commerce' theory.  HN11[
                                    ] To sustain the conviction on
                                    this theory it would be necessary that the jury be given at least basic instructions as to the law pertaining to the
                                    theory and basic instructions which presented the appellants' defense, leaving to the jury to decide whether
                                    appellants' activities were wholly intrastate and whether such activities  [**24]  nevertheless affected interstate
                                    commerce. The question of this 'affect' is a question of fact.
                                    Thus instruction No. 23 stated in part that if the jury found an agreement existed to fix prices or divide up jobs, then
                                    violation of the Sherman Act had been established.  The instruction was proper as pertaining to the 'in commerce'
                                    theory.  It does not touch the 'affect commerce' theory.
                                    The trial judge, after summarizing the allegations of the indictment on interstate commerce which were the basis for
                                    the government's 'in commerce' theory, (par. 12 to 17 incl. thereof; see note 1) then charged the jury as follows in
                                    instruction No. 25:
                                    '* * * if you find these allegations as to commerce to be true, and if you further find beyond a reasonable doubt that
                                    the defendants agreed in advance of the shipment of these supplies into the state of Nevada to fix the prices at
                                    which they would be distributed and sole after the completion of that interstate journey, then I instruct you that such
                                    fixing of prices necessarily affected the free and untrammeled flow of such supplies while they were still in interstate
                                    commerce * * *.'
                                    This instruction fitted into the plan of instruction on the 'in  [**25]  commerce' theory.  But because it stated that
                                    price fixing necessarily affected commerce it did not leave to the jury the factual question of the impact of wholly
                                    intrastate activities on interstate commerce and hence is not available as presenting the 'affect commerce' theory.
                                    [*747]   The trial judge then gave instruction No. 26. 7. [**43]  This was a proper instruction §§ part of the
                                    instructions on the 'affect commence' theory- but it is the only instruction on such theory.
                                    Government counsel now argue the effect of these instructions as follows:
                                    7.  'A combination may be in restraint of interstate trade and commerce within the meaning of the Sherman Act even through
                                    (though) the restraint is applied before the interstate journey beings (begins) or after it has ended.
                                    'Prices fixed in advance to effect a product at the end of its interstate journey are an interference with that commerce, although,
                                    at the time the sale is actually made, the product originating in interstate commerce may actually have come to rest on the shelf
                                    of the 'retailer.' It is the agreement on prices, in advance, which constitutes the violations, not the sale at the price.
                                    'In assaying price-fixing agreements, the test is not so much whether the effect is felt after the movement of the goods has
                                    reached the end of the interstate journey.  The inquiry seeks the effect upon prices in the market.  And if this effect be shown, it
                                    matters not that the movement has come to a halt within the state.'
                                    210 F.2d 732, *746; 1954 U.S. App. LEXIS 4297, **22
                                    
                                    
                                    '* * * Thus there was left to the jury the factual question of whether the defendants agreed in advance of the
                                    shipment of the supplies into Nevada to fix the prices at which they would be distributed and sold after the
                                    completion of that interstate journey.  If the jury so found, and if the jury further found the trade and commerce
                                    allegations to be true, said the court in effect, then in such event it followed as a matter of law, the court instructed,
                                    that such fixing of prices necessarily affected the free flow of such supplies in interstate commerce * * *.'
                                    Government counsel does not analyze his two alternate theories on which he  [**26]  seeks affirmance of the
                                    conviction below.  True, HN12[
                                    ] a price fixing conspiracy which operates on or within the flow of interstate
                                    commerce affects that commerce as a matter of law. But a price fixing conspiracy at a purely local or intrastate level
                                    does not, as a matter of law, affect the flow of commerce. Whether a purely local or intrastate conspiracy
                                    unreasonably restrains interstate commerce is primarily a factual question, i.e. does the local price fixing conspiracy
                                    affect substantially the flow of interstate commerce? If the answer is yes, then only are we concerned with the effect
                                    of the price-fixing under the per se doctrine.  In fact, unless there is a finding that the local and intrastate activities
                                    complained of and as alleged in the indictment, substantially affected interstate commerce, there is no jurisdiction in
                                    a district court over the alleged Sherman Act violation.  Such a finding could only result from proper instructions and
                                    the jury verdict of guilty thereon.
                                    It appears therefore that the court never presented by instructions the alternate theory of 'affect' on commerce. This
                                    could have been done by instructions that if the jury found that interstate commerce  [**27]  terminated when the
                                    plumbing contractors received the supplies, and if the jury found that the plumbing contractors were engaged wholly
                                    in intrastate activities, then the jury should determine whether, nevertheless, appellants' activities as charged in the
                                    indictment, substantially affected interstate commerce in the manner and as charged in Sec. V of the indictment. 8.
                                    [*748]  The Government may have had two strings to its bow, but it obviously failed to fasten one string.  Since we
                                    hold that the 'affect commerce' theory was never presented to the jury, by instructions, we do not consider rejected
                                    instructions.
                                    There remains the question as to whether the appellants suffered any prejudice through the failure to instruct on
                                    the 'affect commerce' theory; relied on by the Government.
                                    This is not a situation where an indictment presents a single theory of guilt and where defendants' theory of defense
                                    thereto, was not submitted to the jury.  Such would, of course, be error.
                                    This is a case where the Government proceeded on two alternate theories relating to (1) matters complained of in
                                    the flow of commerce, and (2) matters complained of in intrastate commerce substantially affecting  [**28]
                                    interstate commerce after the flow in commerce had ceased.  Either theory properly presented to the jury would
                                    support a conviction on the facts of this case.  The appellants contended that their activities were wholly intrastate
                                    and had in fact no substantial effect on interstate commerce and that their acts were done after the flow of goods in
                                    commerce ceased.
                                    This contention, if found by the jury to be true, would be a defense to a prosecution on either the 'in commerce', or
                                    the alternate 'affect commerce' theory.  But under proper instructions given on the 'in commerce' theory, the jury
                                    found a continuous and uninterrupted flow of commerce through the plumbing contractors as conduits, to the places
                                    of installation of the plumbing supplies in southern Nevada and further found that appellants conspired to fix prices
                                    8.  'The purpose, intent and necessary effect of the aforesaid combination and conspiracy has been and is to directly,
                                    unreasonably, arbitrarily and unlawfully restrain and obstruct the flow of plumbing and heating supplies in interstate commerce
                                    into Southern Nevada by:
                                    '(a) Suppressing and eliminating competition among plumbing contractors in the sale, distribution and installation of plumbing
                                    and heating supplies by fixing both the prices of the supplies sold and the prices charged for the subsequent installation of these

                                    '(b) Narrowing and restricting the market in which builders, owners and other consumers are able to purchase plumbing and
                                    heating supplies in Southern Nevada.'

                                    appellants.  The appellants cannot complain, since they have not been hurt.
                                    Substantial effect on interstate commerce
                                    Government counsel argue that it was plainly not for the jury to decide whether a per se violation such as price
                                    fixing has a necessary  [**29]  effect upon commerce; that price fixing at any level necessarily affects interstate
                                    commerce as a matter of law and that the law conclusively presumes such an effect.
                                    Assuming an 'in commerce' situation, we can agree.  But when the 'affect' on commerce theory is presented, it is
                                    clearly a question of fact whether wholly intrastate activities affect interstate commerce in a manner proscribed by
                                    the Sherman Act. After this question is decided, then the per se doctrine may well apply
                                    Appellants argue that the effect on interstate commerce of the acts complained of, must be substantial.  They
                                    contend also the question of substantiality should have been submitted to the jury. The question should have been
                                    submitted on the 'affect commerce' theory.  But we are now concerned with only the 'in commerce' theory remaining
                                    in the case.

                                    The Instructions on the Presumption of Innocence
                                    Appellants complain of a portion of instruction 4 given to the jury.  'The defendants are presumed to be innocent at
                                    all stages of the proceeding, until  [**31]  the evidence introduced on behalf of the government shows them to be
                                    guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.'
                                    Appellants have not complied with Rule 18(2) (d) of this court, supra.  But searching the record for the objection
                                    before the trial judge, we find:
                                    'Instruction No. 4, we object to that on the ground it states the issue negatively, and further the defendants are
                                    entitled to an affirmative statement and a more comprehensive statement thereof.' Appellants urge the effect of the
                                    instruction was to require the jury to discard the presumption of innocence if at any time during the trial they might
                                    find the appellants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
                                    9.  'Violation per se' means that the acts complained of constitute a violation regardless of the alleged reasonableness of the
                                    restraint which is affected thereby or the facts which are offered in justification of the restraint.  As a matter of law the per se
                                    violation has an effect on commerce. 'Violation per se' does not mean (as the government contends) that the acts complained of,
                                    to-wit, a conspiracy to fix prices and divide the market, automatically and illegally affect interstate commerce in a case where
                                    such intrastate activities are alleged to have an 'effect' on the interstate flow of commerce. This is a question of fact.

                                    The court, at the outset of the trial, thoroughly indoctrinated the jury as to the presumption of innocence.

                                    The Alsup Appeal
                                    Alsup has filed separate briefs and in addition relies on the briefs filed in behalf of the other appellants.
                                    (A) The sufficiency of the indictment as to Alsup
                                    Alsup contends that the facts alleged in the indictment were insufficient to constitute an offense against the laws of
                                    the United States insofar as he was concerned.  He contends 'the only portions of the indictment referring to * * *
                                    Alsup appear in paragraph 7 and 19 * * *'.  Paragraph 7 lists Alsup as an indicted co-conspirator and 19(f) alleges
                                    that to secure compliance with the plan to fix prices and allocate  [**34]  bids, Alsup would induce plumbers not to
                                    work for any contractor other than the one designated under the plan.
                                    But Alsup as an indicted co-conspirator was charged with having 'conspired' and taking the allegations of the
                                    indictment as true for the purposes of his contention, a crime was clearly charged against him.  The unlawful
                                    conspiracy was the gist of the crime.
                                    Paragraph 19(f) of the indictment was merely a part of the description of how the unlawful plan would operate.  The
                                    charge against Alsup does not rest merely on paragraphs 7 and 19, but upon the whole of the indictment.
                                    The sufficiency of the indictment to charge an offense under the Sherman Act has been considered heretofore.
                                    210 F.2d 732, *749; 1954 U.S. App. LEXIS 4297, **31
                                    
                                    
                                    (B) The sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction as to Alsup
                                    Alsup raises the contention that the evidence was not sufficient to support his conviction, but the record shows his
                                    active participation in the conspiracy from its inception in mid-August of 1950.  He was present and participated in
                                    the first meeting between the plumbing contractors, when the organization and the setting up of an estimator was
                                    discussed.  Bates, a plumbing contractor present at the meeting testified that  [**35]  he said to Alsup that he 'did
                                    not see how the deal could be made to work.' Alsup replied that he thought 'we will have something that will work
                                    this time.' He said he was in a position where if the people did not go along with him he was in a position to get
                                    them to comply.  The evidence shows further that Alsup forbid journeymen plumbers, employees of Ritter, a
                                    contractor, to work for Ritter until he promised to withdraw a bid which he had given out of line with the purpose of
                                    the conspiracy. In addition, Sylvester, an outside plumbing contractor who was awarded a plumbing contract on the
                                    Las Vegas race track went to Alsup's office to obtain men.  Two of the plumbing contractors, appellants herein,
                                    attempted to get him to back out of the deal.  In Sylvester's presence they asked Alsup to protect them.  Alsup
                                    readily furnished plumbers to Sylvester on another project for the Atomic Energy Commission at the same time he
                                    refused to furnish plumbers to work at the race track.  The jury could rightfully infer, and so did, that Alsup's actions
                                    were in answer to the pleas of the plumbing contractors that they be protected.
                                    The charge is conspiracy and the gist of the crime is the unlawful  [**36]  agreement.
                                    [*751]   The evidence was sufficient to warrant the verdict against Alsup.
                                    (C) There were no errors in the admission or rejection of evidence as to Alsup
                                    Alsup contends that the admission of the testimony given by Hansen of a conversation had with Swan (the
                                    estimator) was error.  Swan told Hansen to contact his office with the proposition that another plumbing company
                                    get a certain contract.
                                    Swan was employed as the estimator by the appellants.  He prepared material for their bid making and kept a
                                    record of which plumbing contractor got the business.  He was either a co-conspirator, though not indicted, or the
                                    agent of the appellant co-conspirators. His statement to Hansen was in furtherance of the conspiracy.
                                    Appellants' attorney at oral argument conceded Alsup was the agent for the defendant co-conspirators. Swan's
                                    conversation as testified to by Hansen was either in furtherance of the conspiracy (if he was a co-conspirator) Clune

                                    ] The rule of criminal agency, although not as broad as in civil cases, applies in criminal cases.  If there is
                                    sufficient evidence and the jury concludes that the acts of the agent were done with appellants' 'authority and under
                                    (their) direction,' Pearson v. U.S., 9 Cir., 1945, 147 F.2d 950, 952, the agents' acts bind the appellants as principals.
                                    U.S. v. Perillo, 2 Cir., 1947, 164 F.2d 645; U.S. v. Gooding, 1827, 12 Wheat. 460, 468, 469, 6 L.Ed. 693; Goldsmith
                                    v. U.S., 2 Cir., 1930, 42 F.2d 133, 138, 139, certiorari denied 282 U.S. 837, 51 S.Ct. 26, 75 L.Ed. 743.
                                    Here there was clear evidence of the agency.
                                    The HN16[
                                    ] supposed distinction between the acts of a co-conspirator and those of an agent in a criminal case,
                                    is in reality one without a difference.  The basic rule is that 'the acts of any agent, within the scope of his authority,
                                    are competent against his principal.' U.S. v. Olweiss, 2 Cir., 1944, 138 F.2d 798, 800. Thus in either situation the
                                    evidence was properly admitted.
                                    Krulewitch v. U.S., 1949, 336 U.S. 440, 69 S.Ct. 716, 93 L.Ed. 790, relied on by Alsup, held that an admission of a
                                    co-conspirator, not  [**38]  in furtherance of the conspiracy, was not admissible.  This rule does not aid the
                                    appellant, Alsup.
                                    210 F.2d 732, *750; 1954 U.S. App. LEXIS 4297, **34
                                    
                                    
                                    The same result would follow as to the same conversation between Swan and Hansen as testified to by witness
                                    Anderson who listened in on a phone extension.  Alsup also alleges error in excluding evidence and relies on the
                                    briefs of the other appellants.  Such a point is not discussed by the remaining appellants.
                                    (D) Alsup's status as a business agent for a labor Union does not give him immunity from prosecution
                                    Alsup contends that his status as a business agent for a labor Union, makes him immune from prosecution.
                                    Labor Unions, their members and officials enjoy no all-inclusive exemption from prosecution under the Sherman
                                    Act.
                                    Cases relied on by Alsup show that HN17[
                                    ] if Unions combine with non-labor groups, U.S. v. Hutcheson, 312

                                    Sherman Act.
                                    Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 1940, 310 U.S. 469, 60 S.Ct. 982, 84 L.Ed. 1311, relied upon by Alsup was a case
                                    where Union defendants  [**39]  were acting on their own without concert with business interests and is hence
                                    distinguishable from  [*752]  the case at hand.  There is no merit to this contention.
                                    Numerous other alleged errors are assigned and discussed but we find the contentions to be without sufficient merit
                                    to immortalize them by discussion, and thus add pages to already crowded law libraries.  The judgments are

                                    337.  (13) The evidence presented before the Special Commissioner showed that Miles' price maintenance policy
                                    and practices were in violation of the Missouri anti-trust laws.  The evidence did show that Miles entered into
                                    agreements and understandings with Missouri retailers to fix the retail price of Miles' products, in violation of the
                                    Missouri anti-trust laws.  Secs. 416.010, 416.020, 416.030, 416.040, RSMo 1949; United States v. A. Schrader's

                                    Miles in maintaining the retail price of its products in Missouri went beyond those permissible under the ""single

                                    before the commissioner showed that the activities of Miles in maintaining the retail price of its products in Missouri
                                    resulted in a system of implied agreements and understandings with retailers throughout the state, contrary to the
                                    Missouri anti-trust laws.  Yankwich, Competition, Real or Soft, 14 F.R.D. 199.

                                    In view of the findings of the Commissioner and the position now taken by the relator, we believe there is no issue
                                    now remaining before the court involving any of the factor-respondents and that a finding of not guilty and an order
                                    of dismissal as to them can properly be entered as of course.
                                    Verne G. Cawley, James C. Wilson and Colvin A. Peterson, Jr., for respondent Miles Laboratories, Inc.; Cawley,

                                    (1) The commissioner's report should be adopted unless affirmatively shown to be wrong.  State ex inf. Barker v.
                                    Armour Packing Co., 265 Mo. 121, 176 S.W. 382.  (2) The burden of proof rests upon the state.  Strong suspicions
                                    or even strong probabilities of guilt are not sufficient; there must be a clear showing fully satisfying the minds of the
                                    court that respondent was guilty as charged.  State ex inf. Crow v. Continental Tobacco Co., 177 Mo. 1, 75 S.W.

                                    anti-trust laws.  The commissioner correctly construed the term ""understanding"" as that term is used in the Missouri
                                    anti-trust laws.  United States v. United Shoe Machinery Co., 234 Fed. 127; 82 C.J.S., Statutes, Sec. 331; 50 Am.

                                    follow the suggested prices is not illegal.  United States v. Colgate & Co., 253 Fed. 522, affirmed, 250 U.S. 300;

                                    administration of the policy of refusing to deal with those who sold Miles products at less than suggested prices was
                                    lawful.  Cream of Wheat Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 14 F. (2d) 40; Toledo Pipe Threading Mach. Co. v.

                                    by Miles resulted in price fixing.  United States v. U.S. Steel Corp., 251 U.S. 417; State v. American Ins. Co., 355

0101 (6).pdf     , 941 ,Counsel    ,"Counsel: Marshall C. Berger, Ira M. Millstein and Irving Scher for appellant.  I. The effect of the decisions below is
                                    to abdicate court control over State statutory public policy.  (Matter of Colletti [Mesh], 23 A D 2d 245, 17 N Y 2d
                                    460; Matter of Bay Iron Works [Eisenstein], 17 A D 2d 804; Durst v. Abrash, 22 A D 2d 39, 17 N Y 2d 445; Wilko v.
                                    Swan, 346 U.S. 427; Matter of Knickerbocker Agency [Holz], 4 N Y 2d 245;  [****3]  Matter of Kingswood Mgt. Corp.

                                    Assn. [Yonkers Raceway], 31 Misc 2d 474.) II. The lower courts' decisions conflict with the purposes and
                                    enforcement policy of the Donnelly Act.  ( Manhattan Stor. & Warehouse Co. v. Movers & Warehousemen's Assn.
                                    of Greater N. Y., 289 N. Y. 82; Kalmanash v. Smith, 291 N.  Y. 142; Consumer-Farmer Milk Coop. v. Milk Drivers &
                                    Dairy Employees Local No. 584, 13 Misc 2d 590.) III. Antitrust affirmative defenses and counterclaims in contract
                                    actions have traditionally been looked upon with disfavor by the courts and are contrary to the principal purpose for
                                    arbitration.  ( Kelly v. Kosuga, 358 U.S. 516; Loew's Inc. v. Radio Hawaii, 20 Misc 2d 587; Fleischmann Distilling
                                    Corp. v. Frontier Liq. Corp., 18 Misc 2d 903; Matter of Mole [Queen Ins.  Co. of America], 14 A D 2d 1; Sporn v.
                                    Hudson Tr. Lines, 265 App. Div. 360.) IV. Tomar's Donnelly Act claim, in effect, is an assertion that the entire
                                    agreement between the parties is void.  (Automatic Canteen Co.  [****4]   of America v. Federal Trade Comm., 346
                                    U.S. 61; Matter of Kramer & Uchitelle [Eddington Fabrics Corp.], 288 N. Y. 467.)
                                    Daniel F. Fitzgerald, Jr., for respondent.  I. Having affirmed the arbitration agreement by initiating arbitration
                                    proceedings, petitioner-appellant may not now raise issues of illegality.  (Matter of Exercycle Corp. [Maratta], 9 N Y
                                    2d 329; Cole v. Mostel, 27 A D 2d 721; Matter of Wrap-Vertiser Corp. [Plotnick], 3 N Y 2d 17; Matter of National

                                    no announced public policy of this State.  (Matter of Standardbred Owners Assn. [Yonkers Raceway], 31 Misc 2d
                                    474; Brooklyn Distilling Co. v. Standard Distilling & Distr. Co., 120 App. Div. 237, 193 N. Y. 551; Cummings v. Union

                                    Orbach's, 266 App. Div. 535.) III. The Donnelly Act claim is not asserted as a defense to, or avoidance of,
                                    contractual liability, but as a proper and related affirmative claim.  ( Kelly v. Kosuga, 358 U.S. 516; Refrigeration
                                    Sales Co. v. York Corp., 32 Misc 2d 231, 18 A D 2d 1140; Sporn v. Hudson Tr. Lines, 265 App. Div. 360; Renault,

                                    Conspiracy and Estoppel
                                    Appellant Consolidation Coal claims error in the District Court's instruction on its various defenses.  Particular
                                    emphasis is assigned to the alleged error in the District Court's instruction on the defense of in pari delicto.  With
                                    reference to this defense, the District Court charged the jury that:
                                    ""Now, the defendants here say that, admitting all of these things for the sake of argument, as we put it,
                                    whatever damage came to the plaintiff, that he was a part of it.
                                    ""He can't claim anything against the coal operators because this arrangement which they had with the UMW
                                    had his approval and endorsement, that he was a member of the BCOA -- Bituminous [**42]  Coal Operators
                                    Association -- that drew up the contract, and that he was a sponsor of it and, therefore, if he got hurt by it, if it
                                    was wrong, he was helping in a wrong, 'impari delicto' [sic] they call it.  That is equal guilt.
                                    [*784]  ""A person who is of equal guilt cannot claim that he has been wronged by other people who assisted or
                                    collaborated with him on the same project.
                                    ""The defendants have entered the defense of 'in pari delicto' -- this means that the defendants say that if an
                                    unlawful conspiracy existed, plaintiff was equally responsible with defendants in the formation of said
                                    conspiracy.
                                    ""Under this defense, the Court charges you that if the plaintiff was a co-initiator of the conspiracy and equally
                                    responsible therefor, plaintiff is not entitled to recover damages for that period of time that the plaintiff remained
                                    a party to the conspiracy.
                                    ""Now, a person may be a party to such an arrangement, be 'in pari delicto,' but he can withdraw from that.  You
                                    are not once brushed with tar that you can't get rid of.
                                    ""So, even though you may believe that he did do this, that he was in this arrangement, entered into this
                                    contract for the purpose of putting other [**43]  operators out of business, yet, if you believe that he withdrew
                                    from and he got out of it and if you find that the defendants were more responsible than the plaintiff for the
                                    formation of the conspiracy, plaintiff may recover, even though it was a party to the conspiracy, even though
                                    South-East Coal Company was a party to the conspiracy.
                                    ""Even though you may find that plaintiff was a party to the conspiracy and if you find that plaintiff withdrew from
                                    the conspiracy and sought to avoid the effects of the conspiracy, it may recover damages arising in the period
                                    of the case subsequent to such withdrawal.""
                                    This charge more than adequately instructed the jury with respect to the defense of in pari delicto, and the effect
                                    South-East's participation in the conspiracy would have on the amount of damages recoverable if termination of its
                                    part in the conspiracy did not occur.  The only difficulty with the instruction is that perhaps it should not have been
                                    given at all.  Recent cases have tended to indicate that for reasons of public policy the defense of in pari delicto is
                                    not available to a defendant in certain types of antitrust cases.  See Perma Life Mufflers, Inc.  v. International Parts
                                    Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 20 L. Ed. 2d 982, 88 S. Ct. 1981 (1968); [**44]  Gaines v. Carrollton Tobacco Board of Trade,

                                    been concluded that the instructions given on this defense were correct, it is not necessary to reach the question of
                                    Appellants'"

                                    15 Appellants also claim error in the instruction because of remarks made by the District Judge which were incorrect statements
                                    of certain dates involving passage of the PWC and ""80-cent clause."" In the supplemental instruction the District Judge corrected
                                    himself and no prejudice resulted from the error.
                                    
                                    
                                    whether the type of antitrust conspiracy involved in this case falls into the category of those antitrust conspiracies in
                                    which the defense of in pari delicto is available.
                                    Consolidation's request for instructions on its defenses of assumption of risk of the conspiracy, waiver of rights
                                    arising from the conspiracy and estoppel were properly rejected by the District Court.  While these defenses might
                                    be proper in certain negligence and contract cases, there is no evidence that Congress intended that these
                                    defenses could be set up by analogy as a defense in an antitrust case.  Furthermore, even if these defenses were
                                    available, it appears that they would be subsumed in the more inclusive defense of in pari delicto.

                                    Consolidation also claims that the District Judge negated one of its primary contentions with [**45]  certain remarks
                                    made in the instructions.  The primary contention allegedly negated by the District Judge's statements was that
                                    much of the injury South-East sought recovery for did not result from the antitrust conspiracy but rather was caused
                                    by a ""serious mistake in judgment in building a cleaning plant costing $5 million and at a point some one hundred
                                    twenty-five miles from the mine . . ."" The remarks made by the District Judge concerned only in a very general
                                    fashion the importance of a cleaning apparatus  [*785]  in processing bituminous coal and the expensiveness of
                                    such a device.  There was copious testimony at trial on both sides of the issue of whether the building of the
                                    cleaning plant by South-East was or was not a mistake in business judgment.  The alleged prejudicial statements
                                    on this matter were made at the very beginning of the charge during a general discussion of the bituminous coal
                                    industry when the meaning of certain jargonistic words and phrases used in the coal industry and at the trial were
                                    explained to the jury.  Towards the end of the instructions, the Judge charged the jury on appellant's bad business
                                    judgment theory of the cause of South-East's injuries.  [**46]  He stated:
                                    ""The defendants take the position that the (conspiracy did not cause plaintiff's injuries) . . . (but the injuries
                                    were) the result of either mismanagement, over expansion, economic conditions, or a combination of these,
                                    with possibly other circumstances, to none of which either of these defendants had any part.
                                    ""That is the theory of the defendants here, that by building this cleaning plant at Irvine, that there was a
                                    significant miscalculation of its cost of construction, more than a million dollars it anticipated to cost; that it was
                                    125 miles in haul from the mines to that plant, which was an additional expense and contrary to good coal
                                    production management, and that by loss of the sale of coal through no fault of Consolidation Coal Company,
                                    but through the failure of the plaintiff to exercise orthodox business acumen; that that is what caused this
                                    plaintiff to lose money, and that through its own failures and no reason to accuse either of these defendants to

                                    If there was a negation of one of appellant's theories by the passing remarks made by the District Judge at the
                                    beginning of the charge to the jury, it obviously was more than compensated for by the explanation of appellant's
                                    position just quoted.  It is concluded that appellants were not prejudiced by certain complained of statements made
                                    by the District Judge in his instructions to the jury.
                                    II. Alleged [**48]  Errors in Evidentiary Matters
                                    A.  Evidence of Effects and Consequences of the Alleged Antitrust Conspiracy
                                    
                                    
                                    The appellants challenge the District Court's ruling on certain evidence offered by South-East which concerned
                                    economic conditions in the coal industry in Eastern Kentucky.  The evidence was principally statistical and related
                                    to such things as: the reduction in the number of miners employed in the coal industry, diminution of population in
                                    certain coal producing areas, wage scales in the bituminous coal industry, quantitive fluctuations in coal production
                                    in various years, income and losses of certain bituminous coal producing companies.  The objection raised to this
                                    type of evidence was that it inordinately emphasized alleged ""effects and consequences""  [*786]  of the antitrust
                                    conspiracy, thereby misleading the jury to believe that the existence of an anti-competitive conspiracy or agreement
                                    could be inferred from these conditions.  It is argued that this Court's decisions in Lewis v. Pennington, 400 F.2d
                                    806 (6th Cir. 1968), and Ramsey v. United Mine Workers, 416 F.2d 655 (6th Cir. 1969), and the Supreme Court's
                                    decision in United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1965), [**49]
                                    specifically rejected the theory that an antitrust conspiracy can be proven by effects and consequences.  The
                                    argument is not clear, but it appears that objection is not made to the admissibility of this type of evidence, rather
                                    that this type of evidence standing alone cannot, as a matter of law, serve as the basis for concluding that an
                                    antitrust conspiracy exists.
                                    In United Mine Workers v. Pennington the Supreme Court stated that HN12[
                                    ] a labor union, having concluded a
                                    wage agreement with one set of employers, may unilaterally seek to impose the same terms on other employers
                                    even though it is believed that ""some employers cannot effectively compete if they are required to pay the wage
                                    scale demanded by the union."" United Mine Workers v. Pennington, at 655, n. 2. It was also observed that ""such
                                    union conduct is not alone sufficient evidence to maintain a union-employer conspiracy charge under the Sherman
                                    Act. There must be additional direct or indirect evidence of the conspiracy."" United Mine Workers v. Pennington, Id.
                                    The textual material, not the language of the footnote quoted above,  [**50]  appears in Lewis v. Pennington and
                                    Ramsey v. United Mine Workers. Appellants' argument apparently relies upon the language quoted above from the
                                    Supreme Court's Pennington decision.  They construe this language to mean that evidence of the effects and
                                    consequences of an alleged conspiracy, e.g., statistics showing marginal producers are losing money and going out
                                    of business, reduction in the number of individuals employed as coal miners, et cetera, are insufficient to prove an
                                    antitrust conspiracy.
                                    It cannot be said definitely that appellants' interpretation of the language in Pennington is either right or wrong.
                                    While this Court finds it difficult to construe that particular language in Pennington as appellants have, some support
                                    for appellants' interpretation of that language can be found in Mr. Justice Goldberg's dissenting opinion in
                                    Pennington appearing in Local Union No. 189, Amalgamated Meat Cutters & Butcher Workmen of North America v.
                                    Jewel Tea Company, Inc., 381 U.S. 676, 714-0715, 14 L. Ed. 2d 640, 85 S. Ct. 1596 (1965). Even though the
                                    language in Pennington is not decisive, there is a logical basis for appellants' position.  The [**51]  ""effects and
                                    consequences"" theory is basically a causal argument.  That is, a cause (the antitrust conspiracy) has produced
                                    certain results or effects (reduction in the number of people employed in the mines, financial losses by marginal
                                    producers, et cetera).  This type of argument has one chief flaw: The difficulty in isolating a single factor causally
                                    responsible for identifiable effects.  Often there are intervening and superseding causes which if shown destroy the
                                    validity of the argument.  The ""effects and consequences"" theory appellants question appears to simply reverse the
                                    usually logical progression from cause to effect by first pointing to certain conditions and then concluding what
                                    caused these conditions.  In any event, the problem of isolating a particular cause which definitely produced certain
                                    effects is still present.  The law cannot be that an antitrust conspiracy can be proven by alleged effects and
                                    consequences of the conspiracy alone.  If the only evidence a plaintiff could produce of an alleged antitrust
                                    conspiracy is statistics showing that they and other producers in an industry are losing money while some
                                    producers make money; that overall production in the [**52]  industry is down while profits of certain companies are
                                    up; and that employment has dropped off in the industry, the defendants  [*787]  should have a verdict directed for
                                    them at the close of plaintiff's case.  Plaintiff would not even have made out a prima facie case for recovery.
                                    Regardless of how accurate these statements might be, they do not apply under the facts of this case.  Reviewing
                                    the record, it becomes obvious that contrary to appellants' contention South-East's case does not rest solely on
                                    alleged effects and consequences to prove the existence of the antitrust conspiracy. South-East presented
                                    evidence of statements made by UMW and Consolidation officials tending to show that there existed an implied or
                                    expressed agreement between the Union and Consolidation; there was evidence of past courses of dealing and
                                    
                                    
                                    performance between itself and Consolidation which were interrupted or changed as a result of Union activity; there
                                    was evidence concerning what happened at bargaining sessions between South-East and the Union which
                                    indicated that some agreement other than the National Agreement (the Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement) existed
                                    between the Union and certain producers.
                                    [**53]  While the question of the sufficiency of this evidence will be dealt with later, the importance of indicating that
                                    South-East introduced other evidence from which the existence of an agreement to restrain trade or competition
                                    could be inferred, is to show that it did not rely solely on alleged effects and consequences of the antitrust
                                    conspiracy to prove its claim. If the only evidence South-East introduced was the statistical evidence referred to
                                    earlier, then the case should never have been submitted to the jury.  However, this was not the only proof they
                                    offered.  Evidence of the type which appellants object to is admissible and can be considered by the jury in drawing
                                    its conclusion on the issue of liability if there is other evidence which supports the claim.  See generally, Local 175
                                    of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers v. United States, 219 F.2d 431 (6th Cir. 1955); Standard Oil
                                    Company of California v. Moore, 251 F.2d 188 (9th Cir. 1957), cert. denied 356 U.S. 975, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1148, 78 S.
                                    Ct. 1139. Therefore, while appellants' argument might be correct as far as it goes, it does not apply to the facts of
                                    this case.
                                    [**54]  B.  Evidence and Statements which Allegedly Personalized South-East Claims Thereby Prejudicing
                                    Appellant
                                    Consolidation maintains they were prejudiced because certain evidence admitted and statements made at the trial
                                    tended to personalize South-East's claim, that is, gave the impression that it was the claim of the LaViers' family
                                    which controls and operates the company.  It is contended that this left the jury with the idea that this was a David
                                    versus Goliath type controversy, with the LaViers family representing the small South-East Coal Company battling
                                    the combined giant forces of Consolidation Coal Company and the United Mine Workers of America.  Thus,
                                    appellants argue that because of this characterization, the jury's sympathies had to lie with the underdog South-
                                    East Coal.
                                    South-East Coal Company, for all intents and purposes, is a family-owned and family -run coal company.  Mr. Harry
                                    LaViers, Senior, and his son, Harry LaViers, Junior, were the controlling forces behind South-East and made the
                                    decisions, either good or bad, for the company.  The company, compared to Consolidation, is a small producer of
                                    coal and its actions are earmarked with the LaViers' name.  While [**55]  there was some personalization of the
                                    company's claim by occasional interchanging of the name plaintiff with Harry LaViers, Senior or Junior, this was no
                                    more excessive than might be expected under the circumstances.  In addition appellants, partially as a result of the
                                    defense of in pari delicto, tended to contribute to any personalization which may have taken place.
                                    Conceding that some personalization of South-East's claim did occur, it is still difficult to accept appellants'
                                    argument that this converted the dispute into a  [*788]  small company versus large company controversy, or
                                    appellants' assumption that a jury's sympathies always rest with the underdog.  Without some additional evidence
                                    that appellants were in fact prejudiced by these characterizations, the record does not support these assertions,
                                    and it is concluded that no injury resulted.
                                    C.  Admissibility of Certain Hearsay Statements
                                    During the trial, South-East introduced into evidence portions of answers made by the United Mine Workers to
                                    written interrogatories.  The Union was asked to admit to the authenticity of certain speeches, editorials and
                                    statements made by Union officials which were appended [**56]  to the Union's answers to the interrogatories, and
                                    then parts of these documents were read to the jury.  Consolidation objected to and now challenges the
                                    admissibility of these statements on the grounds that they were hearsay as against them.  (Consol's objection to the
                                    District Court's refusal to give its requested instruction on this matter was discussed earlier.  See, I. ALLEGED
                                    ERRORS IN INSTRUCTIONS: Section E. Instructions Respecting the Use to be Made by the Jury of Certain
                                    Hearsay Statements, supra, at p. 778).  Consol's principal contention is that statements of this type are not to be
                                    admitted until ""there is independent evidence establishing, prima facie, that such others were members of the
                                    conspiracy."" Standard Oil Company v. Moore, supra.
                                    
                                    
                                    HN13[
                                    ] The general rule is that this type of evidence is admissible, however, subject to exclusion if no prima facie
                                    case of the existence of the conspiracy is established.  The question of conditional admissibility is for the trial judge
                                    to determine.  Carbo v. United States, 314 F.2d 718 (9th Cir. 1963). There [**57]  is no error in conditionally
                                    admitting the statements before a prima facie case was established by independent evidence if subsequently such
                                    a case is proven, because the trial judge has wide discretion over the order of proof.  Pennington v. United Mine
                                    Workers, 325 F.2d 804, 817 (6th Cir. 1963), reversed on other grounds, 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct.
                                    1585 (1965). Flintkote Company v. Lysfjord, 246 F.2d 368, 378 (9th Cir. 1957), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 835, 2 L. Ed.
                                    2d 46, 78 S. Ct. 54. At the close of plaintiff's case there had been established by independent or disassociated
                                    evidence a prima facie case, thus the requirement for having conditionally admitted the statements was met.
                                    D.  Sufficiency of the Evidence
                                    Appellants contend that the jury verdict, and the District Court's denial of their motions for directed verdict and
                                    judgment notwithstanding the verdict are in error, as the verdict ""is not supported by clear evidence, but is contrary
                                    to undisputed facts and applicable legal principles."" Appellants' argument with regard to the ""clear proof"" standard
                                    has already been discussed.  See, I. ALLEGED ERRORS [**58]  IN INSTRUCTIONS, Section A.  The Standard of
                                    Proof Required to Impose Liability, supra, at pp. 772-774. Furthermore, appellants' arguments on applicable legal
                                    principles have also been dealt with, See, I. ALLEGED ERRORS IN INSTRUCTIONS, pp. 774-785, and what
                                    remains is the issue of sufficiency of the evidence.
                                    In considering the sufficiency of the evidence, little if any advantage would be gained by an itemized review of
                                    plaintiff's case.  Much of the evidence introduced at trial was similar to that used at the trials in Tennessee
                                    Consolidated Coal v. United Mine Workers and the retrial of the Pennington case in Lewis v. Pennington.  Yet there
                                    was additional evidence introduced at the trial having particular significance to South-East's claim and which tended
                                    to emphasize that South-East's case was unique from either Tennessee Consolidated Coal or Lewis.  (A single
                                    example is the evidence of the circumstances surrounding the cancellation of the sales agency contract between
                                    Consolidation and South-East in which  [*789]  Consol acted as sales agent for South-East's coal.) While some of
                                    the evidence introduced was circumstantial, which in and of itself might not support [**59]  the jury's verdict, there
                                    was also direct evidence which, when coupled with the circumstantial evidence, raised plaintiff's case from one of
                                    mere suspicion or conjecture to a level where reasonable minds might have concluded liability upon the part of the
                                    appellants.  After reviewing the record, it is concluded that there was substantial credible evidence to support the
                                    jury's verdict.  The District Court's decision on this matter was correct and appellants' motions for directed verdict
                                    and judgment notwithstanding the verdict were properly denied.
                                    III.  ALLEGED IRREGULARITIES WITH RESPECT TO THE JURY
                                    A.  Mr. LaViers' Sr. Conversation with Two Jurymen
                                    Consolidation contends that the District Court committed reversible error in not declaring a mistrial because of a
                                    conversation Mr. LaViers, Sr., of South-East Coal, had with two members of the jury outside of court during the trial.
                                    The conversation took place in a coffee shop in the hotel where some of the witnesses, jurors, attorneys and parties
                                    in the trial were staying.  Mr. LaViers was seated by a waitress at a table which was situated next to another table
                                    where two jurors were eating breakfast. The District Judge, after [**60]  examining Mr. LaViers, 16 found that
                                    appellants were not  [*790]  prejudiced by this unintentional contact and declined to grant a mistrial.
                                    16 The Court made the following examination of Mr. LaViers in ascertaining what took place in the coffee shop:
                                    (Reporter's note:) ""The following occurred at the bench in the immediate presence of counsel and the Court, and in the absence
                                    and out of the hearing of the jury:
                                    ""The Court: I want to clarify this other situation before we get into anything else.  This is out of the presence or hearing of the
                                    jurors, at the bench, in connection with the statement made to the Court by Mr. Schmidt, counsel for the defendant Consolidation
                                    Coal Company with reference to two of the jurors, Mr. Hill and Mr. Osborne, who were seen in conversation with Mr. Harry
                                    LaViers, Sr., at the Coffee Shop of the Phoenix Hotel about 7:30 to 8:00 o'clock this morning, October 11, 1968.
                                    ""Now, then, do you want to make any further statement?  I am just asking.""
                                    
                                    
                                    Off the record.
                                    (Reporter's note:) ""An off-the-record discussion took place at the bench.
                                    ""The Court: Come here, Mr. LaViers, please.  Mr. LaViers, it has been reported to the Court that this morning in the Coffee Shop
                                    at the Phoenix Hotel, you, in the presence of Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Rowntree --
                                    ""Mr. Schmidt: Mr. Rowntree was not present.
                                    ""The Court: No.
                                    ""Mr. Rowntree: As I stated, I was there earlier.
                                    ""The Court: Yes. I don't know who else was there.  But you were seated near or standing near or in the company -- not 'in the
                                    company,' I don't want to use that term -- but in contact with Mr. Hill and Mr. Osborne, who are members of the jury.  Now, do
                                    you recall that incident?
                                    ""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: Yes, I do, Your Honor.
                                    ""The Court: Would you mind stating just what it was?
                                    ""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: Yes, Mr. Rowntree had gone down to breakfast prior to my coming down.  When I came into the Coffee Shop, I
                                    looked for him and found that the table where he was seated only had one chair and I was looking around for some other table
                                    to sit at, and the head waitress came and said, 'Well, just sit down here' -- which was right across the aisle from Mr. Rowntree --
                                    and I sat down on the bench and ordered my breakfast.
                                    And Mr. Hill was sitting next to me, and he asked me, he said, 'Do you know Mr. Oscar Evans who lives in Paintsville?'
                                    And I said, 'Well, he doesn't live in Paintsville now; he has gone to Florida -- but I do know Mr. Evans.'
                                    And he said, 'Well, I used to board at his house.'
                                    And he said he was quite a character.
                                    And I said, 'Yes, I agree with that,' and, 'I knew him very well.'
                                    And then I believe that part of the breakfast, not the main part, was served, and Mr. Hill then asked me if I knew Mr. Nelson
                                    Howard who lived in Paintsville; and I said yes, 'I know Mr. Nelson Howard; he came from Gallatin County; he was in the
                                    automobile business there and later was in the coal business, I know him.' Mr. Hill said he used to work for him.  I said, 'Well, he
                                    was quite an aggressive merchant when he was there, he made a lot of money and decided he would go into the farming
                                    business and bought a couple of farms down in Bourbon County, and I understand, lost what he had of his investment in these
                                    farms.'
                                    I guess the rest of the breakfast was served about that time.  I don't recall that there was -- there was some gentleman came in
                                    on the other side, and they turned to him to speak to him.  I don't recall any further conversation.
                                    There was nothing about this lawsuit.
                                    ""The Court: Do you want to ask him a question?
                                    ""Mr. Schmidt: Mr. LaViers, there were other places to sit down in the Coffee Shop besides next to Mr. Hill and Mr. Osborne when
                                    you sat down?  Isn't that true?
                                    ""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: Well, yes, sir, there are other tables for four and tables for two and the tables at the bench are for two, and the
                                    head waitress came along and tossed a menu down and just said, 'Sit down here,' and I sat where she put the menu.  I didn't
                                    seek out this seat.
                                    ""Mr. Schmidt: You saw them sitting there?
                                    ""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: Oh, yes, I saw them sitting there.
                                    ""Mr. Schmidt: Was it in your mind that, even so, it wouldn't hurt to develop some sort of a social rapport with these gentlemen?
                                    ""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: No, Mr. Schmidt, that was not in my mind.  I am by nature a person who talks to people in the elevator or
                                    wherever it might be, and I would be untruthful and unrealistic if I didn't say I do engage in conversations.
                                    ""The Court: How many minutes would you assume, or how much time, I should say, would you assume your conversation or
                                    what you stated to the Court, or anything in addition to that, was consumed with either of these men?
                                    
                                    
                                    [**61]  Appellants maintain that the case of United States v. Harry Barfield Company, 359 F.2d 120 (5th Cir. 1966),
                                    controls, and a mistrial should have been granted on the basis of that authority.  Reviewing the decision in United
                                    States v. Harry Barfield Company, it appears that several facts instrumental to that decision are lacking in the
                                    present case.  In the Barfield Company case the prejudicial out-of-court conversation took place in an elevator
                                    between the president of the company and two jurors. The president of the company made an effort to approach
                                    the jurors and then ""cemented"" the contact by volunteering information that his wife and her family dealt with the
                                    drug store owned by one of the jurors. The Court observed:
                                    ""By way of summation it is clear that the taxpayer president approached the jurors. They did not approach
                                    [*791]  him.  He sought to identify with juror Lockhart through the fact of knowing about his drug business.  He
                                    then sought to cement the identity by giving the juror his wife's name which led to a conversation regarding his
                                    wife's family.  He apparently also managed to find out that the juror from the radio station had known his [**62]
                                    brother.""
                                    (See the dissenting opinion by Judge Colman in the Barfield Company case, at p. 124, questioning the majority's
                                    characterization of these facts.)
                                    In the present case Mr. LaViers was seated by a waitress next to the jurors. He did not seek them out.
                                    Furthermore, it was a juror who approached Mr. LaViers with a question about whether he knew certain individuals.
                                    Obviously, Mr. LaViers could have simply ignored the juror, but the law does not require that when a person
                                    becomes a party in a lawsuit that he must renounce all social amenities and rudely ignore people who ask him
                                    questions.  The juror's questions were answered by Mr. LaViers in a straight-forward polite fashion, without any
                                    attempt to ingratiate himself to the juror. There was no discussion of the case.  The facts of Barfield Company which
                                    were of principal significance in that decision are lacking here and the case is clearly distinguishable from the
                                    present dispute.  While, of course, these types of contacts must be scrupulously avoided if at all possible, the fact
                                    that in this case the contacts were brought about by a coincidence of circumstances, there was no intentional
                                    ""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: Oh, there were snatches of conversation, I imagine about ten or fifteen minutes.  I was eating breakfast.
                                    ""The Court: That covered the whole period?
                                    ""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: Well, not the whole period of breakfast, but the period of the conversation.

                                    ""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: Mr. Rowntree has continuously cautioned me about this.
                                    ""The Court: Well, you see the point is, I mean, the Court accepts your statement that you didn't say anything about the case.

                                    ""The Court: But, you see, the difficulty is that this more or less currying of favor with a juror -- while I realize it isn't currying a

                                    Kentuckians are just that way -- I know them pretty well -- but we mustn't do anything like this.

                                    was proper and clearly not an abuse of discretion.  United States v. Van Buskirk, 304 F.2d 871 (6th Cir. 1962).
                                    B.  Alleged Error in the District Court's Refusal to Declare a Mistrial because of Certain Conduct of a Juror
                                    Appellants contend that they were denied their constitutional right to trial by an impartial jury because the District
                                    Court refused to grant a mistrial upon learning of certain alleged misconduct of a juror. Two matters are alluded to
                                    as indicating that the partiality of one juror was questionable.  First, an incident occurred during trial which allegedly
                                    was misconduct on the part of the juror. An attorney for the Union developed the following facts: the juror and his
                                    wife attended a social function in Lexington, Kentucky, during the trial. It appeared that the juror's wife was a
                                    sorority sister and close friend of the wife of a lawyer who practiced in the coal mining area of Eastern Kentucky.
                                    The juror was also a close friend of the lawyer.  These people met at the social function, and the juror mentioned
                                    that a third lawyer who practiced in [**64]  the same coal mining region was an attorney for the Union in the trial in
                                    which he was a juror and that this attorney was ""a very able lawyer."" Then the juror's wife made some comment
                                    about the present case being difficult ""in following a conspiracy or in following just what they were driving at with all
                                    the reading and all."" It was not at all clear whether the juror's wife mentioned the word ""conspiracy"" or not. On these
                                    facts a motion was made to subpoena the juror and the people involved in this incident and examine them.  The
                                    District Court concluded that ""nothing (had) been shown here to justify an investigation of this juror"" and overruled
                                    the motion.
                                    Appellant cites Mattox v. United States, 146 U.S. 140, 36 L. Ed. 917, 13 S. Ct. 50 (1892), as controlling and
                                    requiring that under these circumstances an examination of the juror should have been granted.  Under the facts in
                                    Mattox, it was obvious that an examination of the jurors should have taken place.  In that case allegedly a court
                                    bailiff, present when the jury was deliberating the verdict in a murder case, stated, so that the members of the jury
                                    could hear him, that ""this is the third fellow he (the accused)  [**65]  has killed."" In addition, during deliberation the
                                    jury or part of it was read a  [*792]  newspaper account of the trial that included the following remarks:
                                    ""If he (the accused) is not found guilty of murder he will be a lucky man, for the evidence against him was very
                                    strong, or at least appeared to be to an outsider.  The case was given to the jury at noon yesterday, and it was
                                    expected that their deliberations would not last an hour before they would return a verdict.
                                    * * *
                                    ""It (the evidence) was so strong that the friends of Mattox gave up all hope of any result but conviction.""
                                    Under these alleged circumstances, the court should have ordered an examination of the jury to determine the
                                    accuracy of the purported misconduct.  However, by no stretch of the imagination can it be argued that the facts
                                    surrounding the present incident of alleged misconduct approximates those in Mattox.  While questions of jury
                                    improprieties are matters of degree, it cannot be said that the District Court abused its discretion in not ordering an
                                    examination of the juror and the other participants in the present incident without further representation or a
                                    stronger indication [**66]  that some misconduct prejudicial to appellants' constitutional right to an impartial trial did
                                    in fact occur.
                                    The second matter that appellants point to which they contend shows partiality upon the part of this juror is that his
                                    insurance agency underwrote a real estate bond for the son of a former official of and present minor stockholder in
                                    South-East Coal Company.  The juror was challenged for cause, but the District Court overruled the challenge.  The
                                    examination of the juror showed that a $5,000 surety bond must be posted with the Commonwealth of Kentucky
                                    before a real estate broker can sell real estate.  The juror's insurance agency underwrites the bond for the son of a
                                    former official and present minor stockholder in South-East Coal. The bond was first written several years before
                                    this litigation was commenced and simply has been renewed each year. Until informed, the juror did not know for a
                                    fact if he wrote the bond for the son or the father and, obviously, knew neither personally.  Upon questioning, he
                                    stated that the fact he wrote the bond would not affect his judgment in any way.  This case is distinguishable from
                                    Commonwealth Coatings Corporation v. Continental Casualty Company, 393 U.S. 145, 21 L. Ed. 2d 301, 89 S. Ct.
                                    337 (1968), [**67]  cited by appellants to support their position that their challenge for cause of this juror should
                                    have been granted.  In Commonwealth Coatings an individual acting as an arbitrator under a private contractual
                                    agreement had been an engineering consultant for one of the parties in the dispute and collected over $12,000 in
                                    fees in four years.  The Supreme Court set aside an award made by the panel of three arbitrators holding that an
                                    
                                    
                                    arbitrator should disclose to the parties any dealings which might create an impression of possible bias. Factually
                                    and legally, the present case is different.  Here a juror had only remote indirect contact with a party in a lawsuit.
                                    Even if the business contacts were more direct, all that Commonwealth Coatings requires is a disclosure of these
                                    dealings.  In the present case, the nature and extent of the juror's business contacts were disclosed and the District
                                    Court, upon examination of the juror, concluded that he could impartially hear the evidence and return a verdict free
                                    of any prejudice that might result from his business dealings.  The District Court's refusal to grant the challenge for
                                    cause of this juror was not an abuse of discretion.  [**68]  Holt v. United States, 218 U.S. 245, 54 L. Ed. 1021, 31 S.

                                    IV.  Damages
                                    A.  The Jury Award of Damages
                                    South-East sought damages allegedly resulting from the anti-competitive conspiracy in this case for a three and one
                                    half year period from April 26, 1962, to December 31, 1966.  Two methods of computing these damages were
                                    [*793]  used to arrive at a dollar amount. 17 [**69]  The first method was a simple comparison between operating
                                    profits and losses 18 during the period 1952-1958, an arbitrary base period, with the operating profit and losses for
                                    the period South-East sought recovery.  A method similar to this was used in determining the antitrust damages in
                                    Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, 327 U.S. 251, 258, 90 L. Ed. 652, 66 S. Ct. 574 (1946), and Ford Motor Company
                                    v. Webster's Auto Sales, Inc., 361 F.2d 874, 885-886 (1st Cir. 1966).
                                    The second method was more complex and was designed to meet certain objections appellants had to the first
                                    method.  This method used various financial and managerial figures for the years 1964 and 1965 for a comparison
                                    with similar figures in 1962, 1963 and 1966.  Thus, statistics during the actual damages period (1964 and 1965)
                                    acted as a basis for computing damages for the entire period.  Supporting this theory, South-East introduced six
                                    financial exhibits showing, in part: the effects higher mining costs and decreased production in 1962, 1963 and
                                    1966 had on earnings compared to the base years 1964-1965; the effect on earnings of two strikes in 1962-1963
                                    and 1966 as compared with earnings in 1964-1965; lower price realization on coal in 1964-1965 than in the
                                    remaining years of the damage period; and [**70]  the alleged effect the conspiracy had on South-East's price
                                    realization per ton of coal compared with the average price realization of the industry for the period 1962-1965.
                                    South-East maintains that by using this approach appellant's challenge to the validity of using figures for 1952-1958
                                    for the comparison, because allegedly during the damage period internal and external economic conditions were
                                    less favorable than during 1952-1958, are effectively negated.
                                    Appellants raise numerous issues regarding the validity of South-East's theories of damages.  Mention of four of the
                                    challenges will give some idea of the general nature of appellants' attacks.  Respecting South-East's first method of
                                    computing damages, appellants contend that using the profit average of 1952-1958 for the comparison is unfair as
                                    ""internal and external economic factors,"" i.e. less favorable mining conditions and a general overall depression in
                                    the coal market, varied between the years used as a basis and the actual damages period.  The second method is
                                    challenged on the grounds that use of new equipment during 1964 invalidates the comparison of the financial and
                                    managerial date with the base period 1962-1963.  [**71]  The third objection is that both methods claim losses for
                                    Consolidation's refusal to handle South-East's coal and that these losses cannot be recovered from the Union.
                                    Finally, appellants complain that South-East's computed losses which were in part a result of its inability to get
                                    sufficient railroad cars to ship its coal and, therefore, were in no way attributable to the alleged conspiracy.
                                    It appears that most of appellants' challenges to South-East's claims of damages are directed at the accuracy of the
                                    amount of damages and not the fact of damages.  There was a general issue raised as to the lack of evidence
                                    17 Computation of injuries by the first method produced a damages figure of $3,082,816.  The damages figure produced by the
                                    second method was $2,896,713.  The jury awarded damages of $2,410,452 or approximately $700,000 less than the damages
                                    computed by the first method and $500,000 less than computed by the second method.
                                    18 Figures reflecting operating profit and losses rather than net income were used because these figures do not include such
                                    things as percentage depletion allowances which are treated as return of capital, interest payments (expenses) or income,
                                    capital gains and losses and dividend income.
                                    
                                    
                                    showing that the proximate cause of South -East's damages was the conspiracy; that is, the sufficiency of evidence
                                    showing the fact of damages.  However, reviewing the record, it is clear that there was sufficient credible evidence
                                    from which the jury was justified in inferring the necessary causal relation between the conspirators'  [*794]  anti-
                                    competitive conduct and the claimed damage or injury.  Zenith Radio Corporation v. Hazeltine Research, 395 U.S.

                                    Appellants' principal grounds for objection to the jury verdict is that internal and external economic conditions and
                                    decisions of the management resulted in South-East's losses, and not the conduct of the alleged conspiracy. But

                                    support the jury's verdict as to the fact of damages and the amount of damages was computed as precisely as

                                    Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation v. Goldwyn, 328 F.2d 190, 221 (9th Cir. 1964). [**74]  In this case
                                    appellants have not shown either an error in the factual basis of the award or an abuse of discretion.
                                    The judgment is affirmed.

0101 (7).pdf     , 686 ,Counsel    ,"Counsel: Frederic H. Lawrence and Paul C. Gouldin for appellant.  I.  Plaintiff lacks jurisdictional standing to
                                    maintain the first cause [****5]  of action alleged in the complaint.  Loss of business resulting from allegedly illegal
                                    acts of a competitor does not give a plaintiff standing to sue such competitor.  (Empire City Subway Co. v.
                                    Broadway & Seventh Ave. R. R.  Co., 87 Hun 279, 159 N. Y. 555; Geneva-Seneca Elec. Co. v. Economic Power &

                                    has not suffered such special damage as to give it standing.  ( Brooklyn City R. R. Co. v. Whalen, 191 App. Div.
                                    737, 229 N. Y. 570; Belt Line Ry. Corp. v. City of New York, 118 Misc. 665; Surface Transp. Corp. of N. Y. v.
                                    Reservoir Bus Lines, 271 App. Div. 556.) III. The Public Service Law does not give respondent standing.  ( People
                                    ex rel. Delaware & Hudson Co. v. Stevens, 197 N. Y. 1; Public Serv. Comm., First Dist. v. Brooklyn Borough Gas

                                    provisions of subdivisions 2 and 3 of section [****6]  65 of the Public Service Law, prohibiting the granting of any
                                    undue or unreasonable preference, are not applicable to electric service to be rendered a State, municipal or
                                    Federal body under contract.  ( Matter of O'Sullivan v. Feinberg, 201 Misc. 658; Staten Is. Edison Corp. v. New

                                    should be dismissed because it fails to allege the material elements of a cause of action, there can be no tie sales,
                                    and there is no concerted action which violates the General Business Law.  ( Shapolsky v. Shapolsky, 22 A D 2d

                                    required because of respondent's failure to give requisite notice to the Attorney-General.  ( Matter of Aimcee
                                    Wholesale Corp., 21 N Y 2d 621; Manhattan Stor. & Warehouse Co. v. Movers Assn., 289 N. Y. 82.)
                                    Robert M. Diggs for respondent.  I. Respondent, a public utility which furnishes gas for space heating, has standing
                                    to challenge the legality under the Public Service Law of appellant's discriminatory and preferential charges for
                                    electricity, which injure respondent by inducing customers to use electricity instead of gas for space heating.  (
                                    Brooklyn City R. R. Co. v. Whalen, 191 [****8]  App. Div. 737, 229 N. Y. 570; DeMatteis v. McGoldrick Realty Co.,
                                    259 N. Y. 452; Kingsbridge Ry. Co. v. City of New York, 204 App. Div. 369; Surface Transp. Corp. v. Reservoir Bus

                                    Organizations v. Camp, 406 F. 2d 837.) II. Appellant cannot escape the prohibitions in section 65 of the Public
                                    Service Law against unreasonable, discriminatory and preferential charges by serving municipal customers under
                                    special contracts neither filed with nor approved by the Public Service Commission.  ( Nashville Ry. v. Tennessee,
                                    262 U.S. 318; New York Tel. Co. v. Siegel-Cooper Co., 202 N. Y. 502.) III. The complaint alleges a cause of action
                                    under the Donnelly Act by setting forth facts establishing that appellant is abusing its monopolistic position in the
                                    lighting market to restrict the freedom of municipalities to choose among competing energy sources in the space
                                    heating market.  ( Northern Natural Gas Co. v. Federal Power Comm., 399 F. 2d 953; Matter of Aimcee Wholesale

0101 (9).pdf     , 189 ,Counsel    ,"Counsel: Sanford Robert Shapiro and Warren B. Rosenbaum for appellant.  I. The application of the minimum fee
                                    schedule may not avoid a test of ""reasonability"" in determining a lawyer's compensation.  ( Matter of Levy, 19 A D
                                    2d 413; Matter of Snell, 17 A D 2d 490; Matter of Robinson, 202 Misc. 231; Burnett v. Graves, 230 F. 2d 49, 351
                                    U.S.  984.) II. Primary reliance on a minimum fee schedule is per se unreasonable where direct testimony as to
                                    services is available.  ( Matter of Martin, 21 A D 2d 646, 16 N Y 2d 594; Matter of Young, 52 Misc 2d 398.) III.
                                    Section 340 of the General Business Law (Donnelly Act) applies to pricing practices in the furnishing [****4]  of legal
                                    services.  ( Maxine Gerard, Inc. v. May & Co., 51 Misc 2d 711, 27 A D 2d 922; Manhattan Stor. & Warehouse Co. v.
                                    
                                    
                                    Movers' & Warehousemen's Assn., 262 App. Div.  332, 289 N. Y. 82; State of New York v. Milk Handlers &
                                    Processors Assn., 52 Misc 2d 658.) IV. The Monroe County Bar Association's ""minimum fee schedule"" is a
                                    regulated arrangement under the Donnelly Act.  ( Matter of Davies, 168 N. Y. 89; People v. Epstean, 102 Misc. 476;
                                    Purofied Down Prods. Corp. v. National Assn. of Bedding Mfrs., 201 Misc. 149; Pleaters, Stitchers & Embroiderers
                                    Assn. v. Jaffe Pleating Co., 176 Misc. 411; New York Clothing Mfrs.' Exch. v. Textile Furnishers Assn., 238 App.
                                    Div. 444; People v. Sheldon, 139 N. Y. 251; Alexander's Dept. Store v. Orhbach's, 266 App. Div. 535; Straus v.
                                    American Publishers' Assn., 85 App. Div. 446, 177 N. Y. 473; People v. Masiello, 177 Misc. 608.) V. The effect of
                                    the Monroe County Bar Association's minimum fee schedule is to unreasonably fix, establish, stabilize and maintain
                                    price levels for legal services in all of Monroe County.  ( Barns v. Dairymen's League Co-op. Assn [****5]  ., 220
                                    App. Div. 624.) VI. The consumer beneficient policy of the Donnelly Act empowers the court to determine whether
                                    computation of legal fees pursuant to a minimum fee schedule is illegal.  VII. The Bar's exclusive franchise to
                                    render legal services to the public impresses it with a public trust that the courts must closely supervise to protect
                                    the public interest.  ( Whitaker v. Kilby, 55 Misc. 337, 122 App. Div. 895.) VIII. The fee in the instant case, computed
                                    by use of the minmum fee schedule, is unreasonable per se and should not be allowed.
                                    Luther Ira Webster for respondent.  I. The ""reasonableness"" of the fee of respondent's counsel was a question of
                                    fact.  ( Matter of Sewell, 32 Misc. 604; Matter of Potts, 213 App. Div. 59, 241 N. Y. 593; Matter of Brehm, 37 A D 2d
                                    95; Matter of Lipsit, 21 A D 2d 509, 15 N Y 2d 588; Matter of Wheeler, 25 Misc 2d 933; Matter of Krasner, 12 Misc

                                    It is the policy of this State to establish schedules for commissions of fiduciaries.  ( Matter of Burroughs, 155 Misc.
                                    237; Matter of  [****6]   Lester, 172 App.  Div. 509.) III. The interpretation of section 340 of the General Business
                                    Law is for the courts of this State.  ( New York Bank Note Co. v. Hamilton Bank Note Engraving & Print. Co., 180 N.
                                    Y. 280; Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 355 F. Supp. 491; People ex rel. Rice v. Graves, 242 App.  Div. 128;
                                    Johnston v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 242 N. Y.  381; People ex rel. Central Park, North & East Riv. R.

                                    There is no proof of injury to the public.  ( McAvoy v. Harron, 26 A D 2d 452.)
                                    Michael J. Beyma, Elliott Horton and Alan Illig for Monroe County Bar Association, amicus curiae.  I. The legality of
                                    fee schedules is not in issue in the present controversy.  ( Matter of Gilman, 251 N. Y.  265; Matter of Lewis, 278
                                    App. Div. 888,  [****7]  308 N. Y. 795; Hannahs v. Hannahs, 68 N. Y. 610; Matter of Snell, 33 Misc 2d 1044, 17 A D
                                    2d 490; Matter of Richards, 5 A D 2d 124; Matter of De Graff, Foy, Conway & Holt-Harris v. McKesson & Robbins,
                                    31 N Y 2d 862.) II. The law is a noble and ancient profession, the members of which are subject in all aspects of
                                    their conduct and ethics to regulation by the courts.  ( Matter of Rouss, 221 N. Y. 81; Matter of New York County
                                    Lawyers' Assn. v. Dacey, 28 A D 2d 161, 21 N Y 2d 694; Lavanant v. Lovelace, 71 Misc 2d 974; Matter of Cohen, 9
                                    A D 2d 436; Matter of Cooper, 22 N. Y. 67; Erie County Water Auth. v. Western N. Y. Water Co., 304 N. Y. 342;
                                    Matter of Flannery, 212 N. Y. 610; Matter of Percy, 36 N. Y. 651; Matter of Ushkow, 34 A D 2d 159; Matter of
                                    Hughes, 35 A D 2d 440.) III. The absence of Bar Association fee schedules might lead to solicitation of clients
                                    which could be harmful to the legal profession and the public generally.  ( Matter of Clark, 184 N. Y. 222; Matter of
                                    Anonymous, 32 A D 2d 37; Matter of Connelly, 18 A D 2d 466; Matter of Pouker, 203 App. Div. 520; People v.
                                    Meola [****8]  , 193 App. Div. 487; People v. Schneider, 20 A D 2d 408; People ex rel. Karlin v. Culkin, 248 N. Y.
                                    465.) IV. The Donnelly Act applies to the regulation of trade and of services related to trade while the Judiciary Act
                                    applies to the conduct of lawyers; each is exclusive of the other.  ( Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 355 F. Supp. 491;
                                    Matter of Carey v. Cruise, 246 N. Y. 237; New York Clothing Mfrs.' Exch. v. Textile Finishers Assn., 238 App. Div.
                                    444; Emmons v. Smitt, 58 F. Supp. 869; Hillside Housing Corp. v. Eisenberger, 173 Misc. 75; Matter of New York

                                    Antitrust laws do not apply to fees which are determined by a court.  ( Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657;
                                    Eastern R. R. Conference v. Noerr Motors, 365 U.S. 127; Schenley Ind. v. N. J. Wine & Spirit Wholesalers Assn.,
                                    272 F. Supp.  872; California Transp. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508; Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341.) VI.
                                    Numerous Legislatures and courts have found Bar Association fee schedules [****9]  to be in the public interest.  (
                                    
                                    
                                    Matter of Snell, 33 Misc 2d 1044, 17 A D 2d 490; Matter of O'Donnell, 28 Misc 2d 1040; Matter of Robinson, 202
                                    Misc. 231; Matter of Lewi, 199 Misc. 99; Matter of Felton, 199 Misc. 507.) VII. Bar Association fee schedules are an
                                    indispensable aid to attorneys in determining customary charges so that a particular fee is not exorbitant.  ( Matter
                                    of Snell, 17 A D 2d 490; Gair v. Peck, 6 N Y 2d 97.) VIII. Bar Association fee schedules generally discourage unduly
                                    high charges and provide a standard against which unreasonably high charges may be recognized, challenged and
                                    corrected.  ( Matter of McCullough, 14 Misc 2d 769, 10 A D 2d 634, 9 N Y 2d 993.) IX. Legal services performed for
                                    an estate are of a similar nature to the services rendered by fiduciaries whose fees are uniformly set as a
                                    percentage of estate assets.  ( Matter of Snell, 33 Misc 2d 1044, 17 A D 2d 490.) X. The Sherman Act similarly

                                    which are reasonably necessary for the effective prosecution of Arizona's claims.
                                    It appears that in many instances expense claims were not presented promptly and/or periodically.  Prompt
                                    presentation of claims is an indication that the claims are reasonable and that the client would be expected to make
                                    reimbursement without disagreement.  On the other hand, there is a natural tendency to delay claim submissions
                                    which are excessive or which may meet client resistance.

                                    Here again, the parties are in serious disagreement.  The State's contention is fulsomely stated in Special
                                    Counsel's Memorandum of November 16, 1982, pg. 19:
                                    It is no overstatement or exaggeration to say that in the present case counsel overcame overwhelming odds to
                                    accomplish an extremely difficult task and that the result of this victory will work a fundamental change in an
                                    industry representing 10 percent of our gross national product.  The injunction will save consumers tens of
                                    millions [**31]  of dollars annually.
                                    Defendants respond that ""the only tangible 'success' plaintiff will have achieved is  [*1274]  the elimination of a
                                    desirable and cost-effective health care insurance alternative."" Defendants also contest Special Counsel's
                                    assertions that this action ""introduc[ed] competition into a major section of the economy that had previously been
                                    characterized by cartels and monopolistic practices.""
                                    I believe the answer to this particular guideline is dictated by the position taken by the U.S. Supreme Court:
                                    The impact of the foundation fee schedule on medical fees and on insurance premiums is a matter of dispute.
                                    The State of Arizona contends that the periodic upward revisions of the maximum fee schedules have the
                                    effect of stabilizing and enhancing the level of actual charges by physicians, and that the increasing level of
                                    their fees in turn increases insurance premiums.  The foundations, on the other hand, argue that the schedules
                                    impose a meaningful limit on physicians' charges, and that the advance agreement by the doctors to accept the
                                    maxima enables the insurance carriers to limit and to calculate more efficiently the risks they underwrite and
                                    therefore [**32]  serves as an effective cost containment mechanism that has saved patients and insurers
                                    millions of dollars.  Although the Attorneys General of 40 different States, as well as the Solicitor General of the

                                    briefs supporting the State of Arizona's position on the merits, we must assume that the respondents' view of
                                    the genuine issues of fact is correct.
                                    102 S. Ct. at 2472.
                                    The Supreme Court recognized that its acceptance of the per se rule did not constitute a determination that the
                                    business practices at issue were unreasonable:
                                    The costs of judging business practices under the rule of reason, however, have been reduced by the
                                    recognition of per se rules.  Once experience with a particular kind of restraint enables the Court to predict with
                                    confidence that the rule of reason will condemn it, it has applied a conclusive presumption that the restraint is
                                    unreasonable.  As in every rule of general application, the match between the presumed and the actual is
                                    imperfect.  For the sake of business certainty and litigation efficiency, we have tolerated the invalidation [**33]
                                    of some agreements that a fullblown inquiry might have proved to be reasonable.
                                    102 S. Ct. at 2473.
                                    If the injunction entered in this case will save consumers ""tens of millions of dollars annually"", the practices enjoined
                                    must have been costing the public to the same extent.  The way is open for any concerned entity -- including the
                                    State of Arizona -- to file a damage action and thus resolve this contention.  If successful, the (plaintiffs) and
                                    counsel would then be compensated from the common fund developed through that action and their efforts on
                                    behalf of the public. 4
                                    (9) The experience, reputation and ability of attorneys. Defendants [**34]  agree that the services of plaintiff's
                                    counsel were of the ""highest caliber"".  They argue, however, that allowing hourly rates in the range requested by
                                    plaintiff's counsel is sufficient recognition of their skill and expertise.
                                    In my opinion, the hourly rates which I have approved for each counsel fully compensate them for their expertise in
                                    the antitrust area.  These rates are also more than adequate to compensate them based on their experience,
                                    reputation and ability as attorneys in this community.
                                    (10) The ""undesirability"" of the case. Again, this does not seem to be a decisive guideline. The Attorney General
                                    determined to file the action under statutory authority.  The complaint did not seek a  [*1275]  damage award.  Reed
                                    was the Antitrust Division Chief when the case was filed.
                                    There is no evidence that the prosecution of other antitrust actions was delayed or suffered as a result of the filing
                                    of this action.
                                    (11) The nature and length of the professional relations with the client. This guideline only involves Reed.  He was a
                                    member of the Attorney General's staff for a number of years.  When he left that office and went into private
                                    practice, he was awarded [**35]  a contract to handle this case as special counsel.  Several of the individuals with
                                    Reed's firm had previously been with the Attorney General's office.
                                    Reed had an ongoing relationship with the Attorney General's office after November, 1980 in other cases.  He has
                                    appeared as Special Counsel for the State in at least two other antitrust cases.  In re Cement and Concrete
                                    Antitrust Litigation, Civ 78-271-72; In re Arizona Escrow Fee Antitrust Litigation, Cic 80-840A.  Both of these cases
                                    were filed while he was a member of the Attorney General's staff and were progressing while he was involved in the
                                    instant case.  He has received fee awards in the two named cases out of settlement funds.  The Cement case is
                                    now scheduled for trial in April, 1984.
                                    4  The $1.8 million dollar monthly damage figure Plaintiff seeks to utilize was not developed by Defendants.  Rather, it originated
                                    with Plaintiff in its Motion filed January 12, 1979 to Vacate or Modify Stay Order of December 27, 1978.  (Document 74, p. 17)
                                    Maricopa Foundation later referred to Plaintiff's calculation as ""grossly inflated"".  (Document 103, p.6).
                                    578 F. Supp. 1262, *1274; 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20198, **32
                                    
                                    
                                    (12) Awards in other cases. It is difficult to draw any overall conclusions as to the totality of an award to be made in
                                    a particular case, by looking at awards in other cases.  The circumstances of cases differ widely.  The variables
                                    include, among others, issues, extent of discovery, court appearances, the time period over which the case
                                    extended, the number of individuals involved and their functions in the proceeding,  [**36]  results obtained, total
                                    hours claimed, hourly rates and whether the award was made in an adversarial situation.
                                    I have considered other awards in this district in fixing the hourly rates for attorneys and paralegals in this
                                    proceeding.
                                    I have also reviewed the innumerable cases called to my attention through memoranda.  There is something for
                                    everyone in those cases.  The final award in those cases was a discretionary judgment, just as mine will be in this
                                    instance.  An adherence to the Moore requirements should provide a reasonable award in each individual case,
                                    with appellate court review available to a dissatisfied claimant.
                                    Special Counsel cites a fee order (Settlement Order No. 6) in In re Arizona Escrow Fee Antitrust Litigation, Civ. No.
                                    80-840A, in support of its claim as to hourly fees, counsels' expertise and the substantial multiplier requested.  My
                                    review of that order confirms that it was prepared by a fee committee of plaintiffs' counsel, of which Mr. Reed was a
                                    member.  I consider that order and others prepared by similar committees in common fund cases, as limited
                                    authority.  At best, they should be regarded in the same way as the circuit courts consider findings [**37]  of fact
                                    prepared by counsel and entered verbatim by a trial court.  Photo Electronics Corp., v. England, 581 F.2d 772, 777

                                    Counsels' applications for award of attorneys fees include time for preparing and pursuing those applications.
                                    The Antitrust Division claims 73.8 hours for these purposes:

                                    578 F. Supp. 1262, *1275; 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20198, **35
                                    
                                    
                                    [*1276]  Defendants object, contending that time for these purposes is customarily disallowed.  As plaintiff points
                                    out, the authorities relied on by defendants are cases involving a common fund, whereas it is almost uniformly held
                                    that reasonable time claimed for fee issues is allowed the prevailing party in non-fund cases.
                                    The [**38]  reasons for this dichotomy are: The prevailing attorneys in a common fund case will be the recipients of
                                    an award based on the lodestar calculation, with almost inevitable enhancement after a nonadversarial
                                    consideration by a court of Kerr type guidelines. Compensating the attorneys for preparing their fee petitions cannot
                                    arguably benefit the class and/or increase the fund.  Ergo, those types of fee petitions are regularly disallowed.
                                    Here, there is no fund out of which counsel may be compensated. HN7[
                                    ] If the prevailing party is to suffer no loss
                                    through bringing the action, and others are to be encouraged to bring similar public interest actions, the
                                    unsuccessful party may be required to pay a reasonable attorney fee.  The extent to which a fee petition is
                                    contested necessarily adds to the time logged by counsel for the prevailing party. The opposition may be pedantic
                                    or it may result from the nature or extent of fees sought by the other party.
                                    A losing party in an antitrust action would be well-advised to contest only those attorney fee issues, factual or legal,
                                    as to which there is grounds for fair dispute.  Otherwise, the successful party is afforded the opportunity to
                                    expand [**39]  the basic fee dispute itself into a substantial fee generating proceeding.
                                    One proposition is evident: A multiplier should not be applied to the hours spent on an application for attorneys
                                    fees.  The ""risks"" incident to prevailing in the proceeding on the merits are gone.  Any delay in the resolution of the
                                    fee application should be no different than that occasioned in resolving an attorneys fee claim in any other action
                                    where an application is permitted.  In re Equity Funding Corp. of Am. Securities Litigation, 438 F. Supp. 1303, 1330,
                                    C.D. Cal. 1977; Weiss v. Drew Nat. Corp., 465 F. Supp. 548 (S.D.N.Y. 1979). I do not regard the opinion in Kooistra
                                    v. Phoenix Newspapers, Inc., Civ 82-946-Phx, cited by Reed, as persuasive authority to the contrary.  This issue
                                    was not expressly dealt with in the Court's opinion.  It did not discuss cases which considered the issues and
                                    denied a multiplier.
                                    For the same reasons stated in Vulcan Soc. of Westchester Cty v. Fire Department, 533 F. Supp. 1054, 1966
                                    (S.C.N.Y. 1982) "". . . even assuming the Court has discretion to apply the multiplier to the time spent on this motion,
                                    it declines to do so.""
                                    The Attorney General and Special [**40]  Counsel each submitted separate fee applications, with opening
                                    memoranda and extensive memoranda in response to Defendants' objections.
                                    Three Hundred sixty-two hours (362.6) are claimed for preparation and presentation of the two fee petitions.  Using
                                    that time and hourly rates approved by the Court, would result in an award to the Attorney General of $7,657.50,
                                    with an award to Special Counsel of $34,169.50.
                                    I find the time claimed for fee petition purposes is excessive and unwarranted.  The separate memoranda are
                                    duplicative and unnecessarily prolix.  A single, coordinated presentation could easily have been utilized. Rather,
                                    each set of counsel embarked on an independent research and drafting project, with a seeming lack of expertise or
                                    experience in fee petition matters.  Special Counsel even found it necessary to employ five of the firm members on
                                    the project.  This is a type of luxurious law practice which I do not believe exists generally in the private practice of
                                    law, and certainly not for purposes of preparing a fee petition.  It is inevitable that this number of persons on a
                                    project spawn wasted hours and propagate duplication of time. 5
                                    [**41]   [*1277]  Counsels' prior involvement in antitrust cases is the only basis upon which I approved their hourly
                                    rates.  That activity necessarily encompassed fee applications in those kindred cases.  I have reviewed the fee
                                    petitions in other cases involving the Attorney General's office and Reed.  I found essentially the same cases cited
                                    and similar -- if not identical arguments advanced as in this proceeding.  Stated most directly, I find that the time
                                    5  The fee hearing on December 20, 1982 is an example.  Four Reed attorneys charged time for attending this hearing.  The time
                                    for two attorneys was deleted in a supplemental filing in October, 1983.
                                    578 F. Supp. 1262, *1275; 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20198, **37
                                    
                                    
                                    entries here (as elsewhere in this case) demonstrate an excessive belaboring of research and preparation of
                                    memoranda.  As the Court stated in Ramos v. Lamm, 539 F. Supp. 730, 741 (D.Colo. 1982), ""One should not have
                                    to pay for the building of a clock in order to find out the time of day."" Continuing with that analogy, assuming the
                                    cost of building the clock is relevant, the time necessary to build additional clocks should be less after the initial
                                    invention.
                                    The rule which I have followed is well-stated in Lund v. Affleck, 587 F.2d 75, 77, (1st Cir. 1978):
                                    . . .  It would be inconsistent with the purpose of the Fees Act to dilute a fees award by refusing to compensate
                                    the attorney for the time reasonably spent in [**42]  establishing and negotiating his rightful claim to the fee
                                    [citations omitted].  On the other hand, if the attorney's initial claims are exorbitant, or the time spent advancing
                                    them unreasonable, the district court should refuse the further compensation.  The same point we have
                                    emphasized in all fee situations applies here: HN8[
                                    ] it is not enough for the court to multiply a fixed rate by
                                    the number of hours claimed.  The court must satisfy itself of the overall fairness and reasonableness of the fee
                                    under all the circumstances. . . .
                                    The only practical way that I can resolve these claims is by an across the board reduction to correct for what I find
                                    to be excessive and redundant hours.  It is my best estimate, based on a review of the hours claimed and the
                                    issues involved, that a total time of 175 hours would be reasonable for fee petition purposes.  This time covers
                                    preparation of the petition and responding to objections of defendants, as well as providing supplemental
                                    information requested by the Court.  Perkins v. Standard Oil Company of California, 474 F.2d 549 (9th Cir. 1973),
                                    cert. denied, 412 U.S. 940, 37 L. Ed. 2d 400, 93 S. Ct. 2778 (1973); Gagne v. Maher, 594 [**43]  F.2d 336, 345 (2d
                                    Cir. 1979), affirmed, 448 U.S. 122, 100 S. Ct. 2570, 65 L. Ed. 2d 653 (1980). Again, it should be recalled that the
                                    hourly rates allowed counsel are intended to compensate them for their special expertise. Otherwise, these rates
                                    would be significantly lower.
                                    My earlier findings with respect to the Kerr guidelines are applicable to this determination.
                                    Fifty of the one hundred seventy-five hours will be allocated to the Attorney General, with the balance to Special
                                    Counsel.  For purposes of determining the awards in this instance, I will use average hourly rates of $105 and $120,
                                    respectively:
                                    Attorney General
                                    50 hours x $105
                                    $5,250
                                    Special Counsel
                                    125 hours x $120
                                    $ 15,000
                                    Quality and Risk Considerations
                                    The appropriate procedure in this Circuit for calculating a fee award is described in Moore, 682 F.2d at 840, as a
                                    ""blended"" approach, utilizing the ""straight lodestar analysis"" and the ""Kerr guidelines."" The result of this blended
                                    approach is a determination ""whether to augment or decrease the award based on quality or contingency
                                    considerations."" These two considerations will be considered separately.  [**44]
                                    Quality -- The Court in Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc., v. Am. Radiator, Etc., 540 F.2d 102, 117 (3rd Cir. 1976) (Lindy II)
                                    pointed out:
                                    [*1278]  . . . that a consideration of 'quality' inheres in the 'lodestar' award: counsel who possess or who are
                                    reputed to possess more experience, knowledge and legal talent generally command hourly rates superior to
                                    those who are less endowed.  Thus, the quality of an attorney's work in general is a component of the
                                    reasonably hourly rate; this aspect of 'quality' is reflected in the 'lodestar' and should not be utilized to augment
                                    or diminish the basic award under the rubric of 'the quality of an attorney's work.' (Emphasis in original)
                                    578 F. Supp. 1262, *1277; 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20198, **41
                                    
                                    
                                    The Lindy II Court emphasized that HN9[
                                    ] an increase or decrease in the lodestar is to reflect ""exceptional
                                    services only"" and:
                                    . . .  The heavy burden of proving entitlement to such an adjustment is on the moving party.
                                    Plaintiff's counsel handled the case to a successful conclusion, i.e., they prevailed on its per se position.  I find no
                                    reasonable basis for concluding however, that they did so with a ""minimum of time invested"", or that they should be
                                    rewarded because they [**45]  secured a ""substantial benefit"" for the public.  Accordingly, a quality multiplier will not
                                    be allowed.
                                    I have considered applying a negative multiplier because of what I perceive to be a practice of overstaffing,
                                    duplication of effort and the accumulation of excessive time throughout this antitrust proceeding.  In Re Fine Paper
                                    Antitrust Litigation, 98 F.R.D. 48, 84 (E.D.Pa. 1983). I did not employ this type of multiplier in view of the time which
                                    I disallowed.  If additional time was allowed, a substantial negative multiplier would be utilized.
                                    Risk
                                    Lindy II instructs, 540 F.2d at 117:
                                    Under the rubric of 'the contingent nature of success' HN10[
                                    ] the district court should appraise the
                                    professional burden undertaken -- that is, the probability or likelihood of success, viewed at the time of filing
                                    suit.
                                    Three factors, with various elements were suggested as particularly relevant:
                                    1. Analysis of plaintiff's burden.  Subsumed in this category are the following considerations: (a) the complexity
                                    of the case, -- legally and factually; (b) the probability of defendant's liability, -- whether it is clear or dubious;
                                    whether it has been previously suggested by other civil [**46]  or criminal proceedings; whether it is asserted
                                    under existing case law or statutory interpretation, or is advanced as a novel theory; (c) an evaluation of
                                    damages, -- whether the claims would be difficult or easy to prove.
                                    2. Risks assumed in developing the case.  This category subsumes consideration of: (a) the number of hours
                                    of labor risked without guarantee of remuneration; (b) the amount of out-of-pocket expenses advanced for
                                    processing motions, taking depositions, etc.; (c) the development of prior expertise in the particular type of
                                    litigation; recognizing that counsel sometimes develop, without compensation, special legal skills which may
                                    assist the court in efficient conduct of the litigation, or which may aid the court in articulating legal precepts and
                                    implementing sound public policy.
                                    3. The delay in receipt of payment for services rendered.
                                    The Kerr guidelines are essentially an iteration of the Lindy II criteria.
                                    One fact not previously mentioned is worth noting here.  The Attorney General was able, under statutory authority,
                                    to engage in prefiling discovery.  Antitrust staff members also discussed the prefiling investigation with Department
                                    of Justice [**47]  personnel.  Plaintiff is being compensated for all of this time.
                                    The Attorney General was at risk for a much longer period of time than Special Counsel.  Having initiated the
                                    action, the State had an ethical obligation to proceed to a final conclusion.
                                    The State was responsible for advancing all costs and expenses incident to the case.  Special Counsel's contract,
                                    as noted earlier, enabled him to obtain reimbursement on a timely basis for reasonable amounts advanced for a
                                    myriad of purposes.  The fact  [*1279]  that he failed to seek reimbursement is not a risk incident to this litigation.
                                    Special Counsel's contract to represent the State was secured through what was stated at the Fee hearing to be
                                    some type of bidding process.  This occurred within weeks of Reed leaving his position as Chief of the Attorney
                                    General's Antitrust Division. He was certainly aware of, and from a supervisory standpoint, responsible for prior
                                    proceedings and the status of the case when he signed on.  The Attorney General's Office on December 12, 1980,
                                    578 F. Supp. 1262, *1278; 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20198, **44
                                    
                                    
                                    was then, or soon to be, a several times client of Reed.  To read Special Counsel's Fee Petition Memorandum one
                                    would conclude that he boarded a derelict [**48]  ship hopelessly adrift in the Sargasso Sea and miraculously
                                    brought it into harbor, refurbished and resplendent.  And without any assistance from its earlier crew.  I say
                                    nonsense.
                                    Special Counsel and Defendants' counsel engage in a spirited exchange as to the relative possibilities of the United
                                    States Supreme Court taking the case on certiorari when Reed became Special Counsel.  I do not regard this
                                    statistical exercise as a meaningful measure of risk.  Reed, within the parameters of his experience, could readily
                                    estimate the number of hours necessary to brief the case if certiorari was granted.  I suspect that most lawyers and
                                    particularly those of the antitrust bar, would welcome the opportunity to prepare and argue any antitrust case before
                                    the Court.  Particularly so, where prior to the lawyer being engaged, the Court had invited the Solicitor General to
                                    file an amicus brief regarding the merits of the certiorari petition.
                                    Probably as good an assessment as any of the Supreme Court taking the case, was that expressed by H. Robert
                                    Halper, in 49 Antitrust Law Journal 17, 26-27 (1980), in an article titled ""The Health Care Industry and the Antitrust
                                    Laws: Collision Course?"":  [**49]
                                    . . .  The Ninth Circuits two-to-one decision on March 20, 1980 produced three opinions and an almost certain
                                    ticket to the Supreme Court.  At stake is whether the pro se approach or the rule of reason approach should
                                    apply to what was conceded to be an agreement by the county medical society physicians on the maximum
                                    fees they would be reimbursed by a health insurance plan they had established.
                                    Multiplier
                                    After considering the varying risk considerations of the State Attorney General and Special Counsel, I have
                                    concluded to use a risk multiplier of 1.4 for each.  This multiplier will be applied against the lodestar calculations,
                                    exclusive of Fee Petition time.
                                    I recognize that on occasion, courts have not applied the multiplier to time spent subsequent to the date that the risk
                                    was substantially eliminated by a favorable decision on the merits.  Here, that would be sometime in mid-1982,

0213 (5).pdf     ,1483 ,Counsel    ,"Counsel: Robert Abrams, Attorney-General (Bonnie G. Wittner and Shirley Adelson Siegel of counsel), for
                                    appellant.  I. The legislative history of the Donnelly Act demonstrates that physicians who engage in a boycott are
                                    within its scope.  ( State of New York v Mobil Oil Corp., 38 NY2d 460; State of New York v Horsemen's Benevolent
                                    & Protective Assn., 55 AD2d 251; American Med. Assn. v United States, 317 U.S. 519.) II. Precedents in this court
                                    support the People's contention that physicians who engage in a boycott are not exempt from prosecution under the
                                    Donnelly Act.  ( Matter of Freeman, 34 NY2d 1; Matter of Gordon, 48 NY2d 266; Goldfarb v Virginia State Bar, 355
                                    F Supp 491, 497 F2d 1, 421 U.S. 773; United States v Oregon Med. Soc., 343 U.S. 326.) III. That the profession is
                                    regulated [****4]  under the Education Law is irrelevant and confers no immunity from prosecution for an illegal
                                    boycott.  ( State of New York v Horsemen's Benevolent & Protective Assn., 55 AD2d 251; People v Masiello, 177
                                    Misc 608, 271 App Div 875; National Soc. of Professional Engrs. v United States, 435 U.S. 679.)
                                    James M. O'Brien and Kevin J. Murtagh for Frank Oliveto, respondent.  I. The indictment is insufficient, as a matter
                                    of law, since the acts allegedly done by defendant, Oliveto, do no constitute a violation of sections 340 and 341 of
                                    the General Business Law.  ( Matter of Freeman, 34 NY2d 1; Matter of Gordon, 48 NY2d 266; Goldfarb v Virginia
                                    State Bar, 421 U.S. 773; Feminist Women's Health Center v Mohammad, 415 F Supp 1258, 586 F2d 530; Erie R.
                                    R. Co. v Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64; Government of French Republic v Cabot, 190 Misc 517.) II.  Under the reasoning
                                    of Goldfarb v Virginia State Bar, defendants-respondents are not subject to prosecution.  ( Goldfarb v Virginia State
                                    Bar, 421 U.S. 773; American Med. Assn. v United States, 317 U.S. 519; Lucomsky v Palmer, 141 Misc 278.) III.
                                    52 N.Y.2d 440, *440; 420 N.E.2d 929, **929; 438 N.Y.S.2d 737, ***737; 1981 N.Y. LEXIS 2282, ****2
                                    
                                    
                                    The indictment is dismissable as a matter of law on precedent [****5]  -- in addition it cannot be sustained by
                                    traditional concepts of antitrust law.  IV. The record does not support the attacks of the honor of defendants, John
                                    J.  Tigue, Jr., Elliot Silverman, John L. Kase, James O. Drucker and Paula Schwartz Frome for Seth Kaufman,
                                    respondent.  I. The courts below correctly held that the Donnelly Act is inapplicable to the acts charged in the
                                    indictment.  ( Matter of Freeman, 34 NY2d 1; New York Clothing Mfrs.' Exch. v Textile Finishers Assn., 238 App Div
                                    444; Matter of Davies, 168 NY 89; Matter of Williams v Du Mond, 282 App Div 76; S-P Drug Co. v Smith, 96 Misc
                                    2d 305; Goldfarb v Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773; United States v Container Corp., 393 U.S. 333; American
                                    Column Co. v United States, 257 U.S. 377; Feminist Women's Health Center v Mohammad, 586 F2d 530, 591 F2d
                                    1343; Markham v Gray, 393 F Supp 163, affd on other grounds sub nom.  Markham v Anderson, 531 F2d 634.) II. A
                                    holding that the Donnelly Act applies to the acts alleged in this indictment would constitute an unforeseeable
                                    retroactive expansion of criminal liability, in violation of the due process clause.  ( United States v Harriss [****6]  ,
                                    347 U.S. 612; Coates v City of Cincinnati, 402 U.S.  611; Lanzetta v New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451; Connally v General
                                    Constr.  Co., 269 U.S. 385; Matter of Pomeroy v Whalen, 44 NY2d 992; People v Smith, 44 NY2d 613; People v
                                    Phyfe, 136 NY 554; Matter of Consolidated Mut. Ins. Co. v Keepnews, 41 NY2d 982; United States v Laub, 385
                                    U.S. 475; Bouie v City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347.) III. The Donnelly Act should not be construed so as to prohibit
                                    defendants' constitutionally protected activity of petitioning the Legislature.  ( Eastern R. R. Conference v Noerr
                                    Motors, 365 U.S. 127; Thomas v Collins, 323 U.S. 516; First Nat. Bank of Boston v Bellotti, 435 U.S.  765; Metro
                                    Cable Co. v CATV of Rockford, 375 F Supp 350, 516 F2d 220; Wilmorite, Inc. v Egan Real Estate, 454 F Supp
                                    1124, 578 F2d 1372, 439 U.S. 983; Mine Workers v Pennington, 381 U.S. 657; Franchise Realty Interstate Corp. v
                                    San Francisco Local Joint Executive Bd. of Culinary Workers, 542 F2d 1076, 430 U.S. 940; Feminist Women's
                                    Health Center v Mohammad, 586 F2d 530; Lafayette v Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389; Mine Workers v
                                    Illinois Bar Assn., [****7]  389 U.S. 217.) IV. The Donnelly Act, if construed to prohibit the acts alleged in the instant
                                    indictment, imposes involuntary servitude on defendants in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment.  ( Bailey v
                                    Alabama, 219 U.S. 219; Pollock v Williams, 322 U.S. 4; Taylor v Georgia, 315 U.S. 25; People v Lavender, 48
                                    NY2d 334.), Harvey Paticoff for Joel Karen, respondent.  I. The Donnelly Act does not apply to the medical
                                    profession.  ( Matter of Hirschorn v Attorney-General of State of N. Y., 93 Misc 2d 275; Goldfarb v Virginia State
                                    Bar, 421 U.S. 773; National Soc. of Professional Engrs. v United States, 435 U.S. 679; American Med. Assn.  v
                                    United States, 317 U.S. 519; United States v Oregon State Bar, 385 F Supp 507; United States v Philadelphia Nat.
                                    Bank, 374 U.S. 321.) II.  The doctrine of stare decisis excludes professions under the Donnelly Act.  ( Matter of
                                    Broderick v City of New York, 295 NY 363; Brooks v Horning, 27 AD2d 874, 20 NY2d 760; People v Munoz, 40
                                    AD2d 337, 33 NY2d 998; American Med. Assn. v United States, 317 U.S. 519; Matter of Gordon, 48 NY2d 266;
                                    Marsich v Eastman Kodak Co., 244 App Div 295, 269 [****8]  NY 621; Feminist Women's Health Center v
                                    Mohammed, 586 F2d 530.) III. There is no traditional antitrust concept and for that reason, too, the indictment was
                                    properly dismissed.  ( American Med. Assn. v United States, 130 F2d 333, 317 U.S. 519; United States v American
                                    Tobacco Co., 221 U.S. 106; Standard Oil Co. v United States, 221 U.S. 1; United States v Aluminum Co. of Amer.,

                                    466.) IV. The actions of defandant-respondent did not constitute a boycott.  ( State of New York v Horsemen's
                                    Benevolent & Protective Assn., 55 AD2d 251.), Irving Anolik for Samuel J. Roth and others, respondents.  I. The
                                    opinion and decision of Judge Santagata in the court below with respect to the applicability of the Donnelly Act to
                                    physicians is correct and should be affirmed.  ( National Soc. of Professional Engrs. v United States, 435 U.S. 679;
                                    American Med. Assn. v United States, 317 U.S. 519; United States v Oregon State Bar, 385 F Supp [****9]  507;
                                    United States v Philadelphia Nat. Bank, 374 U.S. 321; Matter of Broderick v City of New York, 295 NY 363; Brooks
                                    v Horning, 27 AD2d 874, 20 NY2d 760; People v Munoz, 40 AD2d 337, 33 NY2d 998; Lee v Consolidated Edison

                                    we maintain that a violation of the Thirteenth Amendment and of the bill of attainder clause of the United States
                                    Constitution (bill of pains and penalties) is inherent in the argument of the Attorney-General that defendants-
                                    respondents were required to perform services for patients under the workers' compensation program and the no-
                                    fault law.  ( United States v Lovett, 328 U.S. 303; Whitney Stores v Summerford, 280 F Supp 406, 393 U.S. 9;
                                    People v Saffore, 18 NY2d 101; Matter of Freidus v Leary, 66 Misc 2d 70; Goldfarb v Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S.
                                    773; People v Lavender, 48 NY2d 334.), Jeffrey Weingard and Roy Broudny for S. Peter Ravitz and another,
                                    respondents.  I. The indictment was correctly dismissed on the ground that the Donnelly Act does not apply to the
                                    medical profession and, therefore,  [****10]  does not prohibit a purported combination of professionals which would

                                    restrain the furnishing of their own services.  ( Matter of Freeman, 34 NY2d 1; American Med. Assn. v United
                                    States, 317 U.S.  519; Marsich v Eastman Kodak Co., 244 App Div 295, 269 NY 621; Feminist Women's Health
                                    Center v Mohammad, 586 F2d 530; Matter of Gordon, 48 NY2d 266; Engle v Talarico, 33 NY2d 237; Matter of
                                    Scheftel, 275 NY 135; Matter of Simonson v Cahn, 27 NY2d 1; Baden v Staples, 45 NY2d 889; Seider v Roth, 17
                                    NY2d 111.) II. Dismissal of the indictment is also required by the failure to state a violation of the Donnelly Act since
                                    it fails to contain the essential elements of either a monoply in the furnishing of medical services or a restraint in
                                    competition or the free exercise of any activity in the furnishing of medical services by the respective defendants.
                                    (Matter of Aimcee Wholesale Corp.  [Tomar Prods.], 21 NY2d 621; State of New York v Horsemen's Benevolent &
                                    Protective Assn., 55 AD2d 251.) III. Dismissal of the indictment is also required because it is bottomed upon
                                    allegations constituting constitutionally protected First Amendment activity,  [****11]  including the right to free
                                    speech, assembly and petition.  To the extent that the Donnelly Act may be construed as prohibiting such activity,
                                    the provision must be declared unconstitutional as applied herein.  (Eastern R. R.  Conference v Noerr Motors, 365
                                    U.S. 127; Mine Workers v Pennington, 381 U.S. 657; California Transp. v Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508;

                                    Co., 435 U.S. 389.) IV. Ample grounds exist for the court to conduct an in camera inspection of the Grand Jury
                                    minutes and, thereafter, to sustain the dismissal of the indictment for legal insufficiency and because it is predicated
                                    upon a defective Grand Jury proceeding.  ( People v Fielding, 158 NY 542; People v Percy, 45 AD2d 284, 38 NY2d

                                    York of defendant physicians for exercising their constitutional right not to participate in the workers' compensation
                                    and no-fault programs, is violative of the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against involuntary servitude.  (
                                    Pollock v Williams, 322 U.S. 4; Bailey v Alabama, 219 U.S. 219; Matter of Freeman, 34 NY2d 1; People v Lavender,
                                    48 NY2d 334.) VI. Dismissal of the indictment is required because the State of New York unlawfully singled out
                                    defendants for selective and discriminatory prosecution based upon the constitutionally impermissible consideration
                                    that defendant physicians saw fit to actively participate in a public protest against the State mandated fee schedules
                                    in the workers' compensation and no-fault programs.  ( United States  [****13]   v Falk, 479 F2d 616; People v

                                    States v Gillings, 568 F2d 1307.)
                                    Taylor R. Briggs and Thomas G. Rohback for the Medical Society of the State of New York, amicus curiae.  I. This
                                    court has held that the Donnelly Act does not apply to the learned professions.  ( Matter of Freeman, 34 NY2d 1.) II.
                                    A fortiori the medical profession, like the legal profession, is not covered by the Donnelly Act.  III. Additional
                                    legislative history demonstrates that the Legislature never intended the Donnelly Act to apply to the learned
                                    professions.  IV. Federal case law cannot alter the intention of the New York Legislature in enacting the Donnelly
                                    Act.  ( Goldfarb v Virginia State Bar., 421 U.S. 773; Hotel Edison Corp. v Taylor, 185 Misc 681, 268 App Div 1029,
                                    295 NY 581; Marsich v Eastman Kodak Co., 244 App Div 295, 269 NY 621; Columbia Gas Co. of N. Y. v New York

                                    matter of sound judicial policy, the Freeman precedent should be respected.  (Matter  [****14]   of Freeman, 34

                                    investigation or some hearing affording the complainant a fair opportunity to demonstrate his claim, does not bar,

                                    the Donnelly Act should not invoke the doctrine of primary jurisdiction and refer the entire action to the PSC before

                                    Alcoholic Beverage Control Law § 101-bb is not otherwise protected under the 21st Amendment.  ( Seagram &
                                    Sons v Hostetter, 384 U.S. 35; California Liq. Dealers v Midcal Aluminum, 445 U.S. 97.) IV. Substantial evidence in
                                    64 N.Y.2d 504, *504; 479 N.E.2d 779, **779; 490 N.Y.S.2d 143, ***143; 1985 N.Y. LEXIS 14233, ****5
                                    
                                    
                                    the record supports the administrative finding that petitioner violated Alcoholic Beverage Control Law § 63 (4) and §
                                    101-bb.  (300 Gramatan Ave. Assoc.  v State Div. of Human Rights, 45 NY2d 176; Matter of Avon Bar & Grill v
                                    O'Connell, 301 NY 150; Matter of Levine v Whalen, 39 NY2d 510; People ex rel. Nauss v Graves, 283 NY 383;

                                    Seymour Howard for respondent in the first above-entitled matter.  I.  The statutory minimum resale pricing scheme
                                    constitutes price fixing by a private party without any real participation, supervision or review by the State and
                                    thus [****10]  violates the provisions of the Sherman Antitrust Act and the United States Constitution.  ( California
                                    Liq. Dealers v Midcal Aluminum, 445 U.S. 97; Schwegmann Bros. v Calvert Corp., 341 U.S.  384; Rice v Williams
                                    Co., 458 U.S. 654.) II. The court below correctly held that the 21st Amendment does not shield the statutory
                                    minimum retail pricing scheme of liquors in New York.  ( Seagram & Sons v Hostetter, 16 NY2d 47, 384 U.S. 35,
                                    967; Matter of Mezzetti Assoc. v State Liq.  Auth., 51 NY2d 761.) III. The court below was correct in concluding that
                                    respondent did not engage in another business.
                                    Victor Feingold for Wine, Liquor & Distillery Workers Union Local 1, AFL-CIO and others, amici curiae in the first
                                    above-entitled matter.  I. Section 101-bb (2) does not violate the Sherman Act since it is a permissible exercise
                                    under the State action rule.  ( Battipaglia v New York State Liq. Auth., 745 F2d 166; Seagram & Sons v Hostetter,
                                    384 U.S. 35; Morgan v Division of Liq. Control, 664 F2d 353; Fisher Foods v Ohio Dept. of Liq. Control, 555 F Supp
                                    641.) II. Section 101-bb does not conflict with this court's ruling in Mezzetti II nor with the  [****11]  Midcal decision
                                    of the United States Supreme Court.  ( Morgan v Division of Liq. Control, 664 F2d 353; House of Spirits v Doyle, 72
                                    Misc 2d 1036, 43 AD2d 880, 36 NY2d 815.) III. The minimum consumer's resale price set by section 101-bb is
                                    solely State action and therefore exempt from the Sherman Act under the Parker doctrine.  ( Matter of Admiral Wine
                                    & Liq. Co. v State Liq. Auth., 61 NY2d 858.) IV. Balancing the State's demonstrated interest articulated in section
                                    101-bb outweighs the Federal interest in the Sherman Act.
                                    Martin P. Mehler for Metropolitan Package Store Association, Inc., and others, amici curiae in the first above-
                                    entitled matter.  I.  Alcoholic Beverage Control Law § 101-bb in no way violates the Sherman Antitrust Act.  ( Matter
                                    of Admiral Wine & Liq. Co. v State Liq. Auth., 61 NY2d 858; Battipaglia v New York State Liq. Auth., 745 F2d 166;
                                    Rice v Williams Co., 458 U.S. 654; Matter of Mezzetti Assoc. v State Liq. Auth., 51 NY2d 761; California Liq.
                                    Dealers v Midcal Aluminum, 445 U.S. 97.) II. Section 101-bb is immune from a violation of the Sherman Act under
                                    the doctrine of State action as it was decided under Parker  [****12]   v Brown.  ( Parker v Brown, 317 U.S. 341;
                                    Serlin Wine & Spirit Merchants v Healy, 512 F Supp 936, aff sub nom.  Morgan v Division of Liq. Control, 664 F2d
                                    353.) III. The purposes of Alcoholic Beverage Control Law § 101-bb when balanced against the antitrust challenge
                                    clearly weigh in favor of the State statute and as such are protected by the 21st Amendment.  ( California v LaRue,
                                    409 U.S. 109; House of Spirits v Doyle, 72 Misc 2d 1036, 43 AD2d 880, 36 NY2d 815.)
                                    Lawrence Kill, Steven M. Pesner, Daniel N. Sang, Scott B. Schreiber, Lee H. Karlin, Michael Whiteman and
                                    Anthony A. Dean for Peerless Importers, Inc., and others, amici curiae in the first above-entitled matter.  I. Section
                                    101-bb does not conflict with the Sherman Act because it does not operate through private agreements or
                                    conspiracies.  ( Morgan v Division of Liq. Control, 664 F2d 353; Rice v Williams Co., 458 U.S. 654; Seagram &
                                    Sons v Hostetter, 384 U.S. 35; New Motor Vehicle Bd. v Fox Co., 439 U.S. 96; Exxon Corp. v Governor of Md., 437

                                    section 101-bb directly imposes are State action within the meaning of Parker and therefore exempt from antitrust
                                    challenge.  ( Bates v State Bar of Ariz., 433 U.S. 350; Morgan v Division of Liq. Control, 664 F2d 353; Fisher Foods
                                    v Ohio Dept. of Liq. Control, 555 F Supp 641; Goldfarb v Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773; California Liq. Dealers v

                                    confers an added presumption of legality to section 101-bb.  ( Battipaglia v New York State Liq. Auth., 745 F2d 166;

                                    first above-entitled matter.  IV. Bulletin No. 471 has no impact on the validity of Alcoholic Beverage Control Law §
                                    101-bb (2) and is otherwise in conformity with the Sherman Act and relevant provisions of the Alcoholic Beverage
                                    Control Law.  ( Ahern v South Buffalo Ry. Co., 303 NY 545, affd sub nom.  South Buffalo Ry. Co. v Ahern, 344 U.S.

                                    Seymour Howard for respondent in the second above-entitled matter.  I and II are the same as the first above-

                                    discounts of more than 2% on [****15]  purchases of liquor by retailers, the Liquor Authority does not have the right
                                    or power to permit wholesalers to circumvent that prohibition.  ( Matter of Picone v Commissioner of Licenses, 241

                                    I concur in the result, since the challenged order is one sustaining special exceptions to the pleading of the State of
                                    Texas. I find nothing in such pleadings which support the trial court's conclusion that the Texas statute is
                                    unconstitutional. Any determination of the validity or invalidity of the Texas statute necessarily rests on the facts of
                                    the case. I would make no sweeping declarations concerning the validity [**17]  of the statute in the absence of
                                    evidence establishing the effect of the challenged transaction as applied to the facts of this case. It is not the office
                                    of a special exception to obtain a ruling based on facts not established by the challenged pleading. The Texas
                                    statute is not unconstitutional on its face, and the pleaded facts are insufficient to support a finding of
                                    unconstitutionality.

                                    The focus of the doctrine of ""antitrust standing"" is somewhat different from that of standing as a constitutional
                                    doctrine. Harm to the antitrust plaintiffs is sufficient to satisfy the constitutional standing requirement of injury in fact,
                                    but the court must make a further determination whether the plaintiff is a proper party to bring a private antitrust

                                    (2) where the alleged damages may have been produced by independent factors.

                                    Where unions are neither participants in the relevant market as competitors or consumers nor direct victims of the
                                    alleged restraint, they lack standing to sue under the antitrust laws, even though the unions allege that the
                                    defendants have in fact caused their injuries and have intended to harm them.

                                    Equitable relief under Section 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.S. § 26, is characteristically available even though
                                    the plaintiff has not yet suffered actual injury. The plaintiff need only demonstrate a significant threat of injury from
                                    an impending violation of the antitrust laws or from a contemporary violation likely to continue to recur.

                                    Section 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.S. § 26, should be construed and applied with the knowledge that the
                                    remedy it affords, like other equitable remedies, is flexible and capable of nice adjustment and reconciliation
                                    between the public interest and private needs as well as between competing private claims. Its availability should
                                    be conditioned by the necessities of the public interest which Congress seeks to protect.

                                    It is clear that standing under § 16 of the Clayton Act is less restrictive than under § 4. It remains, however,
                                    necessary for an antitrust litigant to sufficiently demonstrate that the threatened harm is of the type that the antitrust
                                    statute was intended to forestall."

                                    On May 27, 1987, the District Court ordered that the RICO count be dismissed because the one discrete course of

                                    Normally when Congress creates new civil causes of action by statute concurrent jurisdiction in the state courts is
                                    presumed, although the first Congress in the Judiciary Act of 1789 committed exclusive jurisdiction of federal
                                    criminal cases to the federal courts. Judiciary Act of 1789, ch. 20, § 11, 1 Stat. 79, now codified at 18 U.S.C. §
                                    3231. This presumption in civil cases arises both out of federal recognition of the states' independent sovereignty
                                    and from the states' duty under the Supremacy Clause to recognize federal law as paramount. Id; see The
                                    Federalist No. 82 (A. Hamilton). For more detailed discussions of the early development of rules of exclusive and

                                    District courts and state courts have about equally divided on the issue of RICO concurrent jurisdiction, and the
                                    federal courts of appeals have only recently considered the problem. Only the Ninth Circuit, which found jurisdiction
                                    concurrent in a case from California, has squarely faced the issue. See Lou v. Belzberg, 834 F.2d 730 (9th Cir.

                                    intermediate appellate court has held to the contrary, see Thrall Car Mfg. Co. v. Lindquist, 145 Ill. App. 3d 712, 718,

                                    Two other federal courts of appeals have decided that state courts within their circuits were either likely or unlikely
                                    to assume concurrent jurisdiction as a matter of state law. See Dubroff v. Dubroff 833 F.2d 557, 562 (5th Cir. 1987)
                                    (Texas likely); Cullen v. Margiotta, 811 F.2d 698, 732 (2d Cir.)(New York courts unlikely, relying on Greenview

                                    ] The statutory language of civil RICO does not explicitly commit jurisdiction exclusively to the federal courts,
                                    and it is ""black letter law"" that the ""mere grant of jurisdiction to a federal court does not oust the state courts from

                                    court."" It is clear that this language alone does not constitute an ""explicit statutory directive"" for exclusive jurisdiction
                                    864 F.2d 1280, *1282; 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 17582, **4
                                    
                                    
                                    of the type described in Gulf Offshore. But we must examine other language in the statute to explore the other two
                                    ways that Congress may have designed RICO as an exclusively federal cause of action.
                                    There is no ""smoking gun"" legislative history in which RICO sponsors indicated an express intention to commit civil
                                    RICO to the federal courts. Indeed, Professor G. Robert Blakey, now a Notre Dame law professor who as the chief
                                    of the Senate committee staff was the originator of RICO and its principal draftsman, has conceded that ""'no one
                                    even thought of the issue' "" but that if members of Congress had, ""'they would have made [jurisdiction] exclusive.'""

                                    Prof. Blakey's speculation is a slender reed, cf [**9]  Blakey & Cessar, Equitable Relief Under Civil RICO:

                                    legislative history, though short of an express statement, in support of this view and that the legislative sponsors
                                    should be held to have intended an exclusively federal forum for civil RICO.
                                    Although the drafters of RICO consciously avoided placing the provisions of RICO within the Sherman Act, see
                                    Sedima, 773 U.S. at 498-99, they equally consciously borrowed the exact language of the Clayton Act in drafting
                                    the jurisdiction and venue sections for civil RICO, see Sedima, 473 U.S. at 486-88; County of Cook v. MidCon

                                    Cir. 1985).
                                    At the time Congress enacted RICO, section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15 (1964 & Supp. V 1965-69)
                                    provided that ""[a]ny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the
                                    antitrust laws [**10]  may sue therefor in any district court of the United States . . . and shall recover threefold the
                                    damages by him sustained and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.""
                                    Civil RICO's jurisdictional section, HN8[
                                    ]  18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), provides that ""[a]ny person injured in his business
                                    or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United

                                    The identical language is emphasized. What little nonidentical language exists consists of necessary substitutions,
                                    simplifications, and trivial inversions: deletion of ""who shall be;"" substitution of ""a violation of section 1962 of this
                                    chapter"" for ""anything forbidden in the antitrust laws;"" change from ""district court of the United States"" to ""United
                                    States district court;"" and change from ""by him sustained"" to ""he sustains.""
                                    As noted in Sedima, 473 U.S. at 486-88, borrowing from the Clayton Act concept was suggested by the American
                                    Bar Association and proposed by Rep. Steiger. The principal House sponsor,  [**11]  Rep. Poff, described the
                                    treble-damages  [*1284]  provision as ""another example of the antitrust remedy being adapted for use against
                                    organized criminality."" 116 Cong.Rec.35295 (1970); see also 115 Cong.Rec.6993(1969)(statement of Sen.
                                    Hruska).
                                    The first noteworthy point here is that the Clayton Act unmistakably provided for exclusively federal jurisdiction.
                                    There is explicit legislative history that Congress intended exclusivity and rejected a proposal for concurrent
                                    jurisdiction, see 51 Cong. Rec. 9662-64 (1914), and the Supreme Court repeatedly has held against concurrent
                                    jurisdiction, see Marrese v. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 470 U.S. 373, 380-81, 386-87, 84 L. Ed.

                                    Rev. 311, 316-18 (1976)(hereinafter Adjudication in State Court.)
                                    There is no doubt that the actual intent of Congress in enacting the Clayton Act in 1914 was to follow the precedent
                                    of earlier lower federal court rulings that the Sherman Act, enacted in [**12]  1890, had called for exclusively federal

                                    jurisdiction. See Redish & Muench, Adjudication in State Court, 75 Mich. L. Rev. at 317-18 & n.34; Note, Exclusive
                                    Jurisdiction of the Federal Courts in Private Civil Actions, 70 Harv. L. Rev. 509, 51O n. 13 (1957)(hereinafter
                                    Exclusive Jurisdiction). In any event, the Supreme Court later ratified this view of the Sherman Act. See
                                    Blumenstock Bros. Advertising Agency v. Curtis Publishing Co., 252 U.S. 436, 440, 64 L. Ed. 649, 40 S. Ct. 385
                                    (1920).
                                    The second point is that there is unmistakably clear evidence that Congress in 1970 closely patterned the civil
                                    RICO damages action on § 4 of the Clayton Act, which creates exclusively federal jurisdiction. See Agency Holding
                                    Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Associates, 483 U.S. 143, 107 S. Ct. 2759, 2764-65, 97 L. Ed. 2d 121 (1987)(noting, for
                                    statute of limitations purposes, ""similarities in purpose and structure between RICO and the Clayton Act"" and ""clear
                                    legislative intent to pattern RICO's civil enforcement provision on the Clayton Act""); Sedima, 473 U.S. at 489
                                    (""clearest current"" in RICO legislative history is ""reliance on the Clayton Act model""). Some other courts, noting the
                                    absence of evidence that RICO sponsors were actually aware [**13]  of the exclusive-jurisdiction feature of the
                                    Clayton Act, have downplayed this aspect of§ 1964(c). We find it significant because § 1964(c), which parallels § 4
                                    of the Clayton Act, is, after all, private civil RICO's jurisdictional provision. Compare Lou v. Belzberg, 834 F.2d at
                                    736-37; County of Cook v. MidCon Corp., 773 F.2d at 905 n.4.
                                    The third way in which the Gulf Offshore presumption may be rebutted is by a ""clear incompatibility between state-
                                    court jurisdiction and federal interests."" RICO is a criminal statute, and, as the Court in Sedima noted, the civil
                                    portion of the statute derives its meaning from the first two sections which define criminal liability. 473 U.S. at 488-
                                    89. The federal interests embedded in civil RICO are best assessed not by narrow scrutiny of § 1964(c) in isolation
                                    but by examination of the civil RICO damages remedy in the context of the entire RICO statutory scheme.
                                    The legislative history of RICO indicates clearly that the civil damages remedy of § 1964(c) was designed as an
                                    integral part of a broad-front attack on organized crime. Like its model, the Clayton Act, civil RICO seeks to enlist
                                    ""the pressure of 'private attorneys [**14]  general' on a serious national problem for which public prosecutorial
                                    resources are deemed inadequate."" Malley-Duff, 107 S. Ct. at 2764; see Sedima, 473 U.S. at 487 (quoting Rep.
                                    Steiger that the civil remedy ""would enhance the effectiveness"" of the rest of RICO).
                                    The entire scheme has been well described by the commentators: § 1961 defines key concepts, including predicate
                                    acts of ""racketeering activity,"" in the language of criminal liability; § 1962 prohibits different  [*1285]  acts; § 1963
                                    establishes criminal penalties; and § 1964 provides civil remedies on top of the criminal liability. Sections 1965-69
                                    govern venue and process, and provide specially for expedition of actions, discovery and closure of proceedings
                                    brought by the United States. See generally Blakey & Gettings, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
                                    (RICO): Basic Concepts -- Criminal and Civil Remedies, 53 Temp. L. Q. 1009 (1980); P. Batista, Civil RICO
                                    Practice Manual §§ 2.2 - 2.6 (1987).
                                    For three principal reasons, we think that features of the RICO structure are incompatible with concurrent state-
                                    court jurisdiction. First, virtually all of the predicate offenses defined as ""racketeering [**15]  activity"" in § 1961(1)
                                    are themselves prosecutable only in the federal courts. The only exceptions are those generic offenses described in
                                    § 1961(1)(A) that are ""chargeable under State law"" and possibly some ""fraud in the sale of securities,"" §
                                    1961(1)(C). The remaining predicate offenses are enumerated in a long list of federal criminal offenses including a
                                    number of highly specialized areas--drug laws, ERISA, labor, bankruptcy, securities, white slavery, mail fraud--
                                    whose adjudication is committed to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts by statute. See 18 U.S.C. § 3231
                                    (""offenses against the laws of the United States""); 15 U.S.C. § 78aa(1934 Securities Exchange Act violations). The
                                    state courts do not have jurisdiction to interpret and apply these laws, and they are generally unfamiliar with them.
                                    The great preponderance of civil RICO cases allege the federal offenses of mail or wire fraud or federal securities
                                    fraud. See Report of the Ad Hoc Civil RICO Task Force of the ABA Section of Corporation, Banking and Business
                                    Law 57 (1985)(some 80% of civil RICO claims based solely or primarily on mail, wire, or securities fraud). Two
                                    courts who have claimed to  [**16]  the contrary that civil RICO usually involves ""garden variety state law fraud""
                                    have misconstrued these statistics. See Cianci, 710 F.2d at 380 n.3, and in HMK Corp. v. Walsey, 637 F. Supp.
                                    710, 717 (E.D. Va. 1986), aff'd, 828 F.2d 1071 (4th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1009, 108 S. Ct. 706, 98 L.
                                    864 F.2d 1280, *1284; 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 17582, **12
                                    
                                    
                                    Ed. 2d 657 (1988). Not only are most of the predicate offenses exclusively committed to the federal courts, so is
                                    criminal RICO itself, including the often elusive concepts and definitions embedded in §§ 1961 and 1962.
                                    Second, the frequently interstate character of alleged racketeering enterprises means that often predicate acts by
                                    the same defendants will occur in several states. See Malley-Duff, 107 S. Ct. at 2766. State-court jurisdiction would
                                    multiply the risk of inconsistent decisions in state courts in cases brought by different plaintiffs. The state courts
                                    have no multi-district litigation panel and no way to make their decisions on federal law consistent except through
                                    review by the Supreme Court. State court jurisdiction over the complex and ambiguous RICO statute would create
                                    the possibility of conflicting interpretations not only in the 12 regional federal courts of appeals but also in 50 [**17]
                                    states.
                                    Third, the procedural apparatus created by §§ 1965-68 seems inconsistent with concurrent state court adjudication
                                    of § 1964(c) claims. Section 1965(a) and (d)'s extended venue and process provisions would be applicable only to
                                    civil RICO cases brought in federal court, thus creating either a procedural quagmire of multiple state and federal
                                    remedial procedures or a comity-threatening necessity for many state courts to alter radically their normal
                                    procedures. In addition, the remedial and procedural sections of civil RICO place great emphasis on the special
                                    treatment to be accorded to civil actions brought by the United States. These provisions sometimes limit their
                                    application to ""any district court of the United States,"" see §§ 1965(b)(c); 1966; 1968(g)-(j), but sometimes do not,
                                    see §§ 1964(b), 1967. Even if the Attorney General wanted to prosecute a civil RICO case in state court, this
                                    procedural scheme, if it does not commit such cases exclusively to the federal courts, certainly creates enormous
                                    incentives for the Government to litigate there. We find it difficult to accept that the same statutory scheme which
                                    explicitly provides extraordinary procedural  [*1286]  vehicles [**18]  in the federal district courts would silently
                                    contemplate concurrent jurisdiction in state courts, many of which either lack those mechanisms or would require
                                    considerable revamping to afford them.
                                    In summary, while the statutory language of civil RICO does not say ""exclusive jurisdiction,"" the legislative history
                                    strongly suggests that this was the implicit legislative purpose. Moreover, consideration of several unique features
                                    of the RICO definitional and remedial structure demonstrates convincingly that state court jurisdiction would
                                    obstruct strong federal interests in uniform substantive and procedural enforcement of this integrated statutory
                                    scheme to control organized crime affecting interstate commerce. Thus the state court from which this case was
                                    removed lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the RICO claim.
                                    III.
                                    Ordinarily, when a case is removed from a state court which itself lacks subject-matter jurisdiction of the claim that
                                    served as the basis for removal, the pre-1986 doctrine of ""derivative jurisdiction"" comes into play. HN9[
                                    ] That
                                    judicial doctrine holds that a federal district court derives its jurisdiction from the state court from which an action is
                                    removed; if the [**19]  state court had no jurisdiction, the federal court acquires none, even if it would have had
                                    jurisdiction had the action been filed in federal court in the first instance. See Franchise Tax Board v. Construction
                                    Laborers Vacation Trust, 463 U.S. 1, 24 & nn.26-27, 77 L. Ed. 2d 420, 103 S. Ct. 2841 (1983); Minnesota v. United

                                    The doctrine has been much disapproved, see 14A C. Wright, A. Miller & E. Cooper, Federal Practice & Procedure
                                    § 3722 at 284-90, and in 1986 Congress overruled it by statute, see 28 U.S.C. § 1441(e). But the 1986 amendment
                                    was applicable only to ""civil actions"" commenced in state court after June 19, 1986. This action was commenced
                                    before the effective date of § 1441(e), although the RICO claim was added by amendment after that date. HN10[
                                    ]
                                    The operative date under the statute is the date of the commencement of the ""civil action,"" not the date of the
                                    added claim. See 28 U.S.C.A. § 1441(e) note (""The amendment . . . shall apply with respect to claims in civil
                                    actions commenced in State courts on or after . . . June 19, 1986."")
                                    There is, however, an established exception to this [**20]  now repealed problem of removal jurisdiction which we
                                    must discuss. In Grubbs v. General Electric Credit Corp., 405 U.S. 699, 31 L. Ed. 2d 612, 92 S. Ct. 1344 (1972), the
                                    Court held that HN11[
                                    ] when a case is improperly removed but is tried to judgment on the merits without

                                    ""[T]he issue in subsequent proceedings on appeal is not whether the case was properly removed, but whether the
                                    federal district court would have had original jurisdiction of the case had it been filed in that court."" Id. at 702.
                                    The Grubbs rule is eminently sensible and conservative of judicial economy. It was the approach adopted long ago
                                    in this Circuit, see Handley-Mack Co. v. Godchaux Sugar Co., 2 F.2d 435, 437 (6th Cir. 1924); Riggs v. Island
                                    Creek Coal Co., 542 F.2d 339, 343 (6th Cir. 1976), and has been applied recently in a RICO case to which the
                                    doctrine of derivative jurisdiction might otherwise have applied, see Foval v. First National Bank of Commerce, 841
                                    F.2d 126, 129 (5th Cir. 1988). See also Sorosky v. Burroughs Corp., 826 F.2d 794, 801 (9th Cir. 1987).
                                    Unlike Grubbs and the precedents [**21]  cited by the Court in Grubbs, however, this action has not been tried ""on
                                    the merits."" Rather, the District Court dismissed it under F.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) at an early stage, when little or no
                                    discovery had been done. Courts in the Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and Eleventh Circuits have extended the Grubbs rule to
                                    cases on appeal following summary judgment. See, e.g., Able v. Upjohn,  [*1287]  Inc., 829 F.2d 1330, 1334 (4th
                                    Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 963, 108 S. Ct. 1229, 99 L. Ed. 2d 429 (1988); Farina v. Mission Investment
                                    Trust, 615 F.2d 1068 (5th Cir. 1980); Sorosky v. Burroughs Corp., 826 F.2d 794 (9th Cir. 1987); Stone v. Stone,
                                    632 F.2d 740, 742 (9th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 922, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1004, 101 S. Ct. 3158, 101 S. Ct. 3159
                                    (1981); Borg-Warner Leasing v. Doyle Electric Co., 733 F.2d 833, 835 n.2 (11th Cir. 1984).
                                    It is not appropriate to extend the Grubbs exception so far as to include a case like this, when dismissal has come
                                    so early in the pleadings stage that there has been minimal investment of the parties' time in discovery or of the
                                    court's time in judicial proceedings or deliberations. The Grubbs ""waiver"" rule springs from concerns for judicial
                                    economy and from a desire to prevent a party that bided its time [**22]  before raising a defect in removal
                                    jurisdiction from getting a second bite at the apple. We think neither concern is significant here, and thus Grubbs is
                                    inapplicable. Accord, Dyer v. Greif Brothers, Inc., 766 F.2d 398, 401 (9th Cir. 1985)(in case dismissed for failure to
                                    prosecute and failure to attend pretrial conference, ""concern for judicial economy . . . less compelling"" when
                                    dismissed ""at an early stage"").
                                    We express no opinion on the propriety of application of the Grubbs exception to cases resolved on summary
                                    judgment, except to note that summary judgment may involve only limited issues with minimal investment of time or
                                    may require extensive time and effort exceeding that experienced in many cases ""tried on the merits."" Compare,
                                    e.g., Foval v. First Nat'l Bank, 841 F.2d 126, 128-29 (5th Cir. 1988)(limited proceedings; Grubbs nevertheless held
                                    applicable) with Vantine v. Elkhart Brass Mfg. Co., 762 F.2d 511, 518 (7th Cir. 1985)(extensive discovery and
                                    proceeding; Grubbs held applicable).
                                    IV.
                                    The judgment of the District Court is vacated, and the case remanded to the District Court with instructions to
                                    dismiss the case for want of subject-matter jurisdiction.

                                    KRUPANSKY, Circuit Judge, dissenting.
                                    Because I believe that the majority has incorrectly concluded that jurisdiction over civil RICO cases lies exclusively
                                    with the federal courts, I must respectfully dissent.
                                    Although the majority's opinion in the case at bar applies the correct standard, namely that the presumption of
                                    concurrent state court jurisdiction can be overcome if the Congress has confined jurisdiction to the federal courts
                                    by, inter alia, either ""unmistakable implication from legislative history or by a clear incompatibility between state
                                    court jurisdiction and federal interests,"" Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 453 U.S. 473, 478-79, 69 L. Ed. 2d

                                    784, 101 S. Ct. 2870 (1981), it has incorrectly applied this standard in the case at bar. Disregarding the precedent
                                    of the four circuits which have considered this precise issue, 1 the majority has elected, without benefit of
                                    ""unmistakable legislative history"" or ""clear incompatibility"" to override the well-established presumption of
                                    concurrent jurisdiction.
                                    [**24]  The legislative history of RICO does not provide the ""unmistakable implication"" that jurisdiction was
                                    intended to be exclusive. In contrast to the clear support for exclusive jurisdiction found in the Clayton Act's
                                    legislative history, the majority readily concedes that none of the drafters of RICO ""even thought of the issue"" of
                                    concurrent jurisdiction. Nonetheless, the majority maintains that since the jurisdiction  [*1288]  clause of RICO
                                    incorporates language similar to the corresponding Clayton Act clause, jurisdiction over RICO actions, like that over
                                    the Clayton Act, should be exclusively federal.
                                    Although Congress patterned the civil RICO damages action on Section 4 of the Clayton Act, there is no indication
                                    that Congress intended to impress civil RICO plaintiffs with all of the requirements for a Clayton Act action. Other
                                    circuits have uniformly rejected the view that ""RICO should be viewed as an extension of antitrust law in all
                                    respects."" Bennett v. Berg, 685 F.2d 1053, 1059 (8th Cir. 1981)(Clayton Act requirement of ""competitive injury""

                                    damages provision which was seen as a ""supplement to the antitrust laws,"" state courts were found to have concurrent
                                    jurisdiction).
                                    3 In Sedima, the RICO defendants argued that ""just as a Clayton Act plaintiff must allege an 'antitrust injury,' so a RICO plaintiff
                                    must allege a 'racketeering injury,'"" Sedima, 473 U.S. at 485. The Supreme Court rejected this contention, stating that borrowing
                                    from antitrust principles would ""create [] exactly the problems Congress sought to avoid."" Id. at 498-99.
                                    4 Various statements made on the floor of the Senate support this position. Senator Hruska rejected antitrust standing parallels
                                    and called for a broad interpretation of RICO. See 115 Cong. Rec. 6992 (1969). Senator McClellan similarly noted ""there is . . .
                                    no intention here of importing the great complexity of antitrust law enforcement into this field."" Id. at 9567. See also 116 Cong.
                                    Rec. 607 (1970)(statement of Sen. Byrd).

                                    from that faced by this court. In a statute of limitations inquiry, whenever the legislative history is silent, the court is
                                    free to ""borrow"" a limitations period from an ""analogous"" statute such as the Clayton Act. Agency Holding, 107 S.
                                    Ct. at 2762. However, in contrast to the statute of limitations analysis, in the concurrent jurisdiction setting, courts
                                    are not free to draw analogies to other statutes unless the legislature has specifically endorsed such action. In the
                                    event of legislative silence, courts are constrained to enforce the presumption of concurrent jurisdiction and the
                                    exclusive jurisdiction provisions of the Clayton Act may not be ""borrowed"" for civil RICO. See Lou, 834 F.2d at 737.
                                    In short, while it is appropriate to consult the Clayton Act model in determining the limitations period for civil RICO,
                                    the pronouncements of Sedima, 473 U.S. at 498-99, instruct that the Clayton Act model may not be borrowed in
                                    [*1289]  cases like the one at bar in which such ""borrowing""  [**28]  would unduly limit the availability of RICO
                                    claims. Accordingly, the legislative history provides no ""unmistakable implication"" that the Congress intended to
                                    foreclose state court jurisdiction over civil RICO cases.
                                    The majority's alternative argument is that concurrent jurisdiction is precluded because there is a ""clear
                                    incompatibility between state-court jurisdiction and federal interests."" Gulf Offshore, 473 U.S. at 488-89. The
                                    majority rationalizes that: (1) most predicate offenses implicit to RICO come within the exclusive jurisdiction of
                                    federal courts; (2) predicate acts may occur in several different states; and (3) the elaborate venue and process
                                    provisions of RICO are unique to the federal courts and would militate against concurrent state court jurisdiction.
                                    These arguments are contrary to existing precedent.
                                    First, the majority's conclusion that most RICO predicate offenses are exclusively federal in nature is misplaced. It
                                    is true that a number of predicate offenses to RICO prosecutions are identified as mail fraud, securities fraud, or
                                    other similar types of offenses generally characterized as federal crimes; however, they are generally only
                                    nominally ""federal.""  [**29]  As one commentator has noted, ""RICO lets civil plaintiffs sue in federal court for treble
                                    damages based on conduct that historically had been within the exclusive jurisdiction of state courts under common
                                    law principles of tort or contract law."" Cole & McNamara, 12 Litig. 24, 25 (Spring, 1986) ""If anything, RICO involves
                                    federal courts in the adjudication of state law claims rather than the other way around."" Lou, 834 F.2d at 738. See
                                    also United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 586-87, 69 L. Ed. 2d 246, 101 S. Ct. 2524 (1981)(criminal RICO
                                    moves ""large substantive areas formerly totally within the police power of the State into the Federal realm.""). RICO
                                    ""has become a tool for everyday fraud cases."" Sedima, 105 S. Ct. at 3286 (emphasis added). In Sedima, the court
                                    found that fully 37% of civil RICO cases prior to 1985 involved ""common law fraud in a commercial or business
                                    setting."" Sedima, 105 S. Ct. at 3286 n. 16. A more recent study was even more dramatic. The study disclosed that
                                    54.9% of all RICO cases after Sedima involved ""common law fraud"" and another 13.1% involved either
                                    ""nonsecurities fraud"" or ""theft or conversion."" See 62 Civil RICO Report, No. 44 at 7 (April 14, 1987);  [**30]  Blakey

                                    (1988). In short, a majority of all RICO cases involve claims similar in nature to state law fraud, theft, or contract
                                    claims and, accordingly, there is no meaningful support for the majority's position that state courts should be
                                    considered incompetent to judge such charges. The Supreme Court has recently rejected an argument that RICO
                                    claims are ""too complex to be subject to arbitration."" Shearson American/Express, Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U.S. 220,
                                    107 S. Ct. 2332, 2344, 96 L. Ed. 2d 185 (1987). If arbitrators are capable of adjudicating RICO claims, there is no
                                    reason why state courts cannot hear such claims. 5
                                    [**31]  The majority next urges that the interstate character of RICO precludes concurrent state jurisdiction and that
                                    exclusive jurisdiction is necessary to decrease the risk of ""inconsistent decisions.""
                                    5 The Supreme Court's analysis in McMahon is instructive. The court specifically decided that there was no ""irreconcilable
                                    conflict between arbitration and RICO's underlying purposes."" 107 S. Ct. at 2344. Since no conflict exists between arbitration
                                    and RICO's purposes, the majority must bear a heavy burden to show why there is such conflict between state court jurisdiction
                                    and RICO.
                                    864 F.2d 1280, *1288; 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 17582, **27
                                    
                                    
                                    It is, however, well-established that states have the authority to adjudicate  [*1290]  cases ""arising from events in
                                    other states."" Gulf Offshore, 101 S. Ct. at 2877. The judicial authority of the government looks beyond its own
                                    locality even ""though the causes of dispute are relative to the laws of the most distant part of the globe."" Id. The
                                    majority's argument, taken to its ultimate conclusion, would justify the elimination of concurrent jurisdiction in
                                    virtually all federal cases. Given the strong presumption in favor of concurrent jurisdiction, such an argument is
                                    untenable.
                                    Neither would the majority's position eliminate the risk of inconsistent decisions. As the Supreme Court has noted,
                                    ""even a finding of exclusive jurisdiction over claims arising under a federal statute usually will not prevent a state
                                    court from deciding a question collaterally."" Hathorn v. Lovorn, 457 U.S. 255, 102 S. Ct. 2421, 2428-29, 72 L. Ed.
                                    2d 824 (1982). State courts may, for example, adjudicate federal affirmative defenses to a cause [**32]  of action
                                    even if they cannot decide the exclusively federal cause of action itself. See generally, Note, Exclusive Jurisdiction
                                    of the Federal Courts in Private Civil Actions, 70 Marv. L. Rev. 509, 510-511(1957).
                                    For the foregoing reasons, the Supreme Court has specifically rejected the premise that concurrent jurisdiction
                                    would produce unworkable confiict and inconsistent decisions. Such conflicts are ""not necessarily unhealthy,"" the
                                    court has reasoned, and are not a significant factor in the exclusive jurisdiction inquiry:
                                    It is implicit in the choice Congress has made that ""diversities and conflicts"" may occur, no less among the courts of
                                    the eleven federal circuits, than among the courts of the several States, as there evolves in this field of labor
                                    management relations that body of federal common law of which Lincoln Mills spoke. But this not necessarily
                                    unhealthy prospect is no more than the usual consequence of the historic acceptance of concurrent state and
                                    federal jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law. To resolve and accommodate such diversities and conflicts
                                    is one of the traditional functions of this Court.
                                    Charles Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney, [**33]  368 U.S. 502, 82 S. Ct. 519, 526, 7 L. Ed. 2d 483 (1962).
                                    Similarly, in Hathorn, 102 S. Ct. at 2430 n. 23, the court rejected respondents' claim that concurrent state
                                    jurisdiction would frustrate federal enforcement of the federal statute in question. The court concluded that
                                    ""[c]ommon notions of collateral estoppel suggest that the state proceedings . . . would not bind other interested
                                    persons who did not participate in them. . . . Persons dissatisfied with a state court's collateral lateral resolution. . .
                                    are likely to be able to litigate the issue anew in federal court."" Id. The court thus recognized the possibility that
                                    federal courts would render decisions inconsistent with state verdicts. Indeed, the court welcomed federal
                                    intervention to correct state verdicts with which other interested parties were dissatisfied. Accordingly, the court
                                    found jurisdiction over the Voting Rights Act to be concurrent, notwithstanding the possibility of conflict. Id.
                                    In view of the Supreme Court's unambiguous pronouncements concerning the uniformity issue, it should be clear
                                    that ""the need for uniformity in the application of federal standards is not alone a sufficient basis on which federal
                                    courts may determine [**34]  that their jurisdiction is exclusive."" See Nordlicht v. New York Telephone Co., 799

                                    The majority's final charge that the procedural apparatus, particularly the venue and process service provisions, of
                                    RICO "" [*1291]  seems inconsistent with concurrent state court adjudication"" is equally misplaced. The majority
                                    reasons that the act contains so many incentives to litigate in federal court that concurrent jurisdiction would have
                                    little practical importance and the Congress must have intended federal jurisdiction to be exclusive.
                                    6 The Nordlicht court relied on the Supreme Court's decisions in Pan American Petroleum Corp. v. Superior Court, 366 U.S. 656,

                                    However, in other contexts, the courts have found jurisdiction to be concurrent even though concurrent jurisdiction
                                    would be of little practical importance. In the civil rights context, for example,  [**35]  the Supreme Court has held
                                    that state courts may entertain 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claims 7 even though the drafters of the law probably thought
                                    concurrent jurisdiction to be ""of little practical importance."" See Nichol, Federalism, State Courts, and Section 1983,

                                    Nor do the federal venue and service provisions incorporated into the RICO statute afford a persuasive reason to
                                    support exclusive federal jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has decided that concurrent jurisdiction exists over Labor
                                    Management Relations Act § 301(a) suits 8 despite the LMRA's procedural requirements, which includes venue and
                                    process sections like the RICO provisions upon which the majority relies. Most recently, the Supreme Court has
                                    also decided that concurrent jurisdiction exists over cases to enforce the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1973(c) 9
                                    despite the fact that 42 U.S.C. § 1973 specifies procedural requirements for actions arising under § 1973(c).
                                    Additionally, the Eleventh Circuit has  [**36]  found that concurrent jurisdiction exists for actions under the Anti-tying
                                    Provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act even though that act contains enforcement and venue provisions
                                    similar to those in the civil RICO statute.  Lane, 756 F.2d at 817.
                                    From my review of the record, herein, none of the majority's proffered rationales persuasively supports the requisite
                                    ""clear incompatibility between state court jurisdiction and federal interests."" Gulf Offshore, 453 U.S. at 478-79.
                                    Concurrent jurisdiction ""encourage[s] enforcement of RICO and provides an appropriate role for state courts in
                                    cases involving essentially state law."" Lou, 834 F.2d at 739. Until Congress manifests a contrary intent, ""the
                                    judiciary should not restrict a statute whose plain language directs a sweeping attack at deeply entrenched
                                    economic and social ills."" Note, The Conflict Over RICO's Private Treble Damages Action, 70 Cornell L. Rev. 902,
                                    939 (1985). Accordingly, I would join the Fourth, Fifth, Seventh and Ninth Circuits in their approval of
                                    concurrent [**37]  state and federal jurisdiction and respectfully enter my dissent to the majority opinion.

                                    have been filed in connection with plaintiffs' application for preliminary injunctive relief. These submissions, to the extent they are
                                    referred to herein, are identified as follows: Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Support of Application for Preliminary Injunctive Relief filed

                                    [**3]  In short, this case involves two plaintiffs who are being denied access to a supply of  [*618]  food products
                                    which they would like to distribute. Plaintiffs claim that defendants' collective refusal to sell them various food
                                    products constitutes at least two per se violations of the antitrust laws. As per se violations, it is claimed that the
                                    purported reasonableness of the defendants' selling restrictions should not even be considered by the court under
                                    the so called ""rule of reason"" analysis. Defendants, on the other hand, claim that because the selling restrictions do
                                    not constitute per se violations of the antitrust laws, the restrictions should be considered under the rule of reason. It
                                    is further claimed the restrictions should not be deemed anticompetitive because they promote ""interbrand
                                    competition.""
                                    Fressie is the president and sole shareholder of Bascom Food. In addition, Fressie is a shareholder of defendant
                                    Reese Foods. From 1971 until June 23, 1988, Fressie served as president, chief executive officer and director of
                                    Reese Foods. From 1971 until January 31, 1989, Bascom Food performed various general management functions
                                    for Reese Foods. According to the Complaint,  [**4]  Bascom Food did virtually everything for Reese Foods
                                    including sourcing, purchasing, product development, financing of Reese Foods' working capital through lines of
                                    credit and pursuant to Fressie's personal guarantees, order entry, billing, bookkeeping and all other administrative
                                    functions. In addition, Bascom Food performed other functions for Reese Foods such as warehousing and
                                    manufacturing. Complaint, paras. 17, 18.
                                    As discussed below, Fressie's and Bascom Food's positions at Reese Foods have been terminated. 2 Certain of the
                                    individual defendants now control Reese Foods. These defendants have entered into a voting trust agreement,
                                    pursuant to which plaintiffs claim the defendants have garnered a controlling interest in Reese Foods for the
                                    purpose of enforcing anticompetitive restraints. 3

                                    [*619]  Reese Foods (previously known as ""V.I.P. Foods"") was incorporated in 1971 under the laws of Delaware.
                                    The founding members of Reese Foods, including Fressie, desired to create a buying and distribution cooperative
                                    composed of, and owned by, a group of specialty food distributors. Through the group's collective buying power it

                                    Reply Certification of John A. Fressie, filed May 9, 1989 (""Fressie Reply Cert.""); Affidavits of the following individual defendants
                                    (previously filed in the state court action), filed on May 22, 1989: Dorf, Kehe, Greenhouse, Wine and Beers (collectively, the
                                    ""defendants' state court affidavits""); Letter Brief of Defendants, filed on May 23, 1989 (""Defendants' Letter Brief"").
                                    2 On September 30, 1988, in response to the termination, Bascom Food and Fressie filed an action against the present
                                    defendants in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Bergen County, Docket No. C-17324-88E (the ""state court
                                    action""), seeking damages for breach of Bascom Food's express or implied management contract, for breach of fiduciary duties
                                    and for other claims.
                                    3 On the issue of how the voting trust was established, and why, various defendants stated in affidavits filed in the state court
                                    action:
                                    Finally, after years of disenchantment with Fressie, I and other shareholder/distributors saw an opportunity to get someone
                                    to run Reese who would be accountable to the Reese shareholder/distributors.
                                    A group of shareholder/distributors including Jerry Kehe, Gary Greenhouse, Lee Schultz and me (sic) consulted with
                                    counsel as to how best to proceed with the replacement of Fressie and the termination of the Reese-Bascom management
                                    relationship. The method chosen was a voting trust in which one person, the trustee of the trust, would vote the shares of
                                    all members.
                                    See defendants' state court affidavits, paras. 6-7.
                                    715 F. Supp. 616, *617; 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7087, **2
                                    
                                    
                                    was contemplated Reese Foods would be able to purchase specialty food products at favorable prices,  [**6]  which
                                    would enable the members to better compete in the marketplace. Mains Cert., para. 2.
                                    In many respects, Reese Foods appears to be more of conduit for, and of, the members of the purchasing
                                    cooperative than a stand alone entity. Reese Foods appears to have generated no actual profits for itself. Instead, it
                                    has sold specialty food products (mostly under its own private Reese Foods or Reese Foods-owned labels) to its
                                    shareholder/distributors at market discounts and with substantial cash rebates. Reese Foods has no plant and
                                    equipment, no hard assets, and no employees to speak of. According to the Complaint, Reese Foods is, in many
                                    respects, a ""paper corporation"" 4 consisting essentially of a distribution network of competing individuals (or their
                                    companies) with the right to sell Reese Foods products. Complaint, para. 14. Historically, Reese Foods has had
                                    retained earnings of approximately $ 30,000 to $ 50,000 annually. In addition to the market discounts on goods
                                    sold, Reese Foods has distributed over $ 7 million in cash rebates to its shareholder/distributors since 1972. Id.
                                    [**7]  The original concept of Reese Foods was to give each distributor the exclusive right to sell Reese Food
                                    products in his own geographic territory. Fressie Aff., p. 4. It is alleged the Reese Foods shareholders and
                                    distributors operate separate and independent companies at the same horizontal level of the specialty foods
                                    market, selling specialty foods to individual retail distributors.
                                    Reese Foods currently sells private label brands of spices, seasonings, gourmet food items and other high-quality
                                    food products (""specialty food products"") to approximately thirty distributors throughout the United States. Twenty of
                                    the distributors are presently shareholders of Reese Foods. At one time all distributors were shareholder/members
                                    of Reese Foods; today certain distributors have been selected who are not shareholders. The majority of
                                    distributors, however, continue to be shareholder/members of Reese Foods.
                                    Reese Foods' distributors are, generally speaking, independently operated and are under no contractual obligation
                                    to purchase any products from Reese Foods. As indicated below, however, the original shareholders have had an
                                    affirmative obligation to sell Reese Foods products. Over the  [**8]  years, the number of individual products in the
                                    Reese Foods specialty food product line has grown substantially. On August 20, 1971 (when Fressie and three
                                    other specialty food distributors, Norm Wine, Sr., Harry Mains, and Jack Heffner, each invested a few hundred
                                    dollars in exchange for one share of stock in V.I.P.) each shareholder agreed he would purchase two hundred
                                    cases of popcorn salt which Bascom Food would manufacture and sell to V.I.P. and which V.I.P., in turn, would sell
                                    to each of the three individual shareholder/distributors. Since that time, Reese Foods has grown into a diverse
                                    specialty foods distributor, with revenues in 1988 of approximately $ 43 million.
                                    Fressie has played a significant role in the growth of Reese Foods. He has allegedly created distinctive Reese
                                    Foods brand names and labels (including El Rio, Da Vinci, Ty Ling), as well as its art, advertising and packaging.
                                    He allegedly provided all of the financing for Reese Foods through lines of credit guaranteed by Bascom  [*620]
                                    Food and Fressie personally. Since 1971, with the popcorn salt and ""cheezy-buttery"" popcorn seasoning, Fressie
                                    developed new specialty food items and generated marketing interest among the  [**9]  shareholders. Reese Foods
                                    now has a product line of over five hundred items. Complaint, para. 22.
                                    According to Fressie, ""in many other products such as smoked oysters, artichokes and capers, Reese is the
                                    dominant market factor."" Fressie Reply Aff., para. 13. As a general matter, it is alleged that trade in specialty food
                                    products is a significant element of interstate commerce. Complaint, para. 9. The defendants, on the other hand,
                                    maintain that Reese Foods has neither monopoly position nor dominant market share in any of its markets. It is
                                    asserted that Reese Foods is price-competitive.
                                    Da Vinci pasta, for example, allegedly competes with DiCecco and other pastas manufactured by Borden Co.
                                    which, according to trade reports, sells approximately eight hundred million pounds of pasta per year. Reese Foods
                                    sells seventeen million pounds of pasta per year. Defendants claim there are at least a dozen brands of pasta with
                                    4 At oral argument, counsel for defendants indicated Reese Foods was expanding its staff to some degree, the suggestion being
                                    that it was actually more than a paper corporation or conduit of the defendants. Reese Foods, however, continues to be owned
                                    entirely by a number of the distributors.
                                    715 F. Supp. 616, *619; 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7087, **5
                                    
                                    
                                    which they compete. In addition, there are approximately thirty-five companies that belong to the National Pasta
                                    Association, a national association of pasta suppliers to the grocery market. 5 Beers Aff., para. 4.
                                    [**10]  Reese Foods' line of El Rio Mexican food products, according to the defendants, competes with many
                                    manufacturers including the Old El Paso brand, marketed by a division of Pet, Inc., and Oretega, La Preferida and
                                    Tio Sanchez brands. Defendants similarly argue that Reese Foods' Ty Line Oriental food line competes with
                                    Kikkoman, the China Bowl brand of Estee, as well as Ka-Me brand, a division of Shafer Clarke, Inc. Market share
                                    figures for these Mexican and Chinese food products were not supplied.
                                    Fressie claims that Reese Foods, with $ 43 million in annual sales, is the largest specialty food company in the
                                    United States. Defendants dispute this, arguing that The Specialty Food/Knorr Division of CPC International and
                                    The Specialty Food Division of Heinz International are believed to be larger. Defendants further argue that the size
                                    of Reese Foods is not particularly relevant in light of the intensive product competition in the retail grocery store
                                    business. According to defendants, ""although Reese Foods has products in one or two categories that are
                                    especially popular,"" Reese Foods products generally are not the major brand in the particular product category.
                                    Beers Aff., para. 6.
                                    [**11]  There has not been adequate evidence offered to determine, on a product-by-product basis, whether Reese
                                    Foods dominates -- or is a significant factor -- in any particular submarket for specialty food products. Attached as
                                    Appendix A to this opinion is a listing of revenues earned by Reese Foods in a number of product lines. 6 While
                                    many of the revenue figures would not tend to suggest Reese Foods enjoys a dominant market position in various
                                    markets (although there appears to be at least some economic impact), it is not possible to assess the market
                                    position without determining the scope of the product market. Furthermore, it is not possible to determine whether
                                    the ""product market"" definitions (discussed infra) for many of the individual products are especially narrow because
                                    of uniqueness in the Reese Foods products.
                                    [**12]  A limited amount of evidence, primarily in the form of affidavits, has been offered which suggests that at
                                    least certain Reese  [*621]  Foods products have narrow product market definitions. Clifford Koons, the vice
                                    president of purchasing for Grocers Specialty Company, stated that: ""We try to substitute another specialty food
                                    lines, Fancifood from McLane Company. However, their product quality, packaging and product assortment is
                                    simply not comparable to Reese in our customers mind [sic]. We have lost business from customers who will not
                                    accept Fancifoods as a substitute for Reese."" Koons Cert., para. 4.
                                    Another food distributor has stated that: ""There are no adequate substitutes available to me for some of the Reese
                                    product line, particularly Reese artichoke hearts and its cooking wines."" Michael Cert., para. 3. As to the Da Vinci
                                    pasta, a third specialty food distributor stated: ""The packaging of their Da Vinci pasta, for example, has been
                                    particularly good and that product has obtained a significant foothold in the specialty foods market."" Dick Cert.,
                                    para. 5. Importantly, even certain of the defendants (Dorf, Kehe, Greenhouse and Wine) stated in affidavits in the
                                    state court action that:  [**13]  ""As a distributor, I depend upon the timely and orderly supply of Reese products.
                                    Reese is my largest line of specialty food products."" Id. at para. 11.
                                    As indicated, Fressie was recently terminated from his management position at Reese Foods; the individual
                                    members of Reese Foods have elected defendant John Beers (""Beers"") to be CEO, 7 apparently because Fressie
                                    5 Beers estimates that the United States pasta market share is dominated by Borden with twenty-five percent, Hershey with
                                    eighteen percent, CPC Int. with fifteen percent, General Foods with eight percent and Quaker Oats with three percent. These
                                    ""giants"" in the food industry thus control sixty-nine percent of the retail pasta market. Beers Aff., para. 4.
                                    6 The Reese Foods products which may well have a ""market impact,"" particularly if these products are somewhat unique,
                                    include: artichokes (with 1988 sales of $ 3.7 million), certain kinds of fish (with 1988 sales of $ 5.3 million), various kinds of pasta
                                    (with aggregate 1988 sales of several million dollars) and various Mexican food products (with 1988 sales of several million
                                    dollars).
                                    7 In an effort to demonstrate his autonomy and independence from the shareholders who elected him, Beers states that: ""There
                                    are no Reese shareholder votes or board of director actions required to confirm [his] authority to take actions in areas of [his]
                                    715 F. Supp. 616, *620; 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7087, **9
                                    
                                    
                                    was less responsive to the membership's will. According to the Complaint, Fressie was removed from Reese Foods
                                    because he refused to enforce unlawful restraints of trade, to the dissatisfaction of the defendants and other
                                    shareholders. It is alleged, for example, that from 1971 until the time of his termination as Reese Foods' president
                                    in 1988, Fressie received several complaints from Reese Foods shareholders and distributors of ""unauthorized""
                                    sales of Reese Foods products by competing distributors in claimed territories. Fressie refused to prohibit these
                                    sales. Complaint, para. 29.
                                    [**14]  According to the defendants, Beers has unilaterally decided not to deal with Fressie as a distributor because
                                    he presented a variety of problems. 8 In an effort to undercut plaintiffs' argument that they were terminated for
                                    failure to enforce a particular distribution policy, defendants attempt to argue there never was an actual policy, but
                                    instead mere ""brainstorming"" about the possibility of enacting a policy. This suggestion, however, is belied by the
                                    fact that Reese Foods had been soliciting antitrust advice for a decade on the legality of the policy and also by a
                                    December 19, 1988 memorandum from Beers to the shareholders. That memorandum indicates that a formal policy
                                    is, and has been, in existence:
                                    The fact remains that Reese, under the anti-trust laws, has a legal right to put into place reasonable policies
                                    designed to promote the orderly marketing and distribution  [*622]  of its products. The original policy of Reese
                                    was to forbid the diversion of merchandise to non Reese distributors. Unfortunately, prior management never
                                    enforced the policy, however, the policy is still in effect and we're going to start enforcing it. 9
                                    [**15]
                                    Fressie, now removed from the management of Reese Foods, seeks to be a regular full line distributor of Reese
                                    Foods products and to compete in regions already covered by Reese Foods distributors. It is the refusal of Reese
                                    Foods (and the individual defendants) to deal with Fressie which gives rise to this lawsuit. 10 Fressie claims the
                                    refusal of the defendants to deal with him stems from a fear of competition from a distributor who intends to sell
                                    CEO authority and responsibility. This CEO authority is ensured by both a two-year employment contract and by a voting trust of
                                    a majority of Reese corporate stock supporting [Beers'] management."" Beers Aff., para. 2.
                                    8 Beers, as a justification of the decision to deny Fressie distributor status, contends, among other things, Fressie has a record of
                                    self dealing, Fressie sells a competitive line of products, Fressie would attempt to destroy the market position of Reese Foods,
                                    Fressie and Bascom Food are not full line specialty food distributors and Fressie has brought lawsuits against Reese Foods.
                                    Beers Aff., para. 10.
                                    It is noted that the lawsuits referred to by Beers involve the refusal of Reese Foods to deal with Fressie. Accordingly, the
                                    lawsuits do not logically form a separate basis for the current refusal to deal. Moreover, on the issue of the degree to which
                                    Fressie, through malice or inability, might cause Reese Foods' market position damage in any way, Fressie has stated: ""If, at the
                                    end of one year of free and open competition, Bascom is not buying and selling at least as much Reese product as the current
                                    lowest volume Reese distributor, I will surrender my Reese shares to the corporation for nothing."" Fressie Reply Aff., para. 27. In
                                    light of the absence of persuasive support for Beers' flat accusations against Fressie and the foregoing representation, it does
                                    not appear as though Fressie presents any particular danger to Reese Foods; the justifications advanced by Beers appear to be
                                    pretextual.
                                    9 A copy of this December 19, 1988 memorandum from Beers to the Reese Foods shareholders was supplied at oral argument
                                    by counsel to plaintiffs.
                                    10 As indicated, Fressie has brought the state court action to redress his termination from management of Reese Foods.
                                    The refusal by defendants to deal with Fressie as a Reese Foods distributor occurred for the first time in December of 1988. On
                                    December 23, 1988, Bascom Food ordered ten containers of Reese Foods' DaVinci pasta, at a cost of approximately $ 167,000.
                                    Bascom Food's order was confirmed by written purchase orders, #5002-5011, dated December 27, 1988. On January 26, 1989,
                                    Bascom Food also purchased three thousand bundles of smoked oysters from other Reese Foods distributors for resale to the
                                    specialty foods retail market. By memorandum, dated January 27, 1989, defendant Beers on behalf of Reese Foods, demanded
                                    to know what Bascom Food intended to do with the DaVinci pasta. Defendants refused to fill the order until Fressie provided that
                                    information. By letter, dated February 17, 1989, Beers stated to Fressie: ""Please be advised that effective March 20, 1989
                                    Bascom Food Products, Inc. will be discontinued as a food service distributor.""

                                    Reese Foods products to centralized retail warehouses, other distributors, and wholesale grocers at a lower price,
                                    rather than on the established ""store to door"" basis, as described below.
                                    [**16]  Fressie claims the defendants, in refusing to deal with him, are eliminating the competition he could bring to
                                    existing territories by selling Reese Food products through different channels. Defendants are allegedly enforcing a
                                    ""store to door"" sales policy which prohibits a distributor from selling directly to centralized warehouses of wholesale
                                    grocers or to the warehouses of large supermarket chains, except within the distributor's established territory. This
                                    excludes potential distributors like Bascom Food and Fressie, which for historical reasons do not have an agreed-
                                    upon territory, from competing in the specialty foods market. Fressie Aff., paras. 19-21.
                                    According to the defendants, Reese Foods depends on the success of its distributors and their promotion and
                                    marketing of Reese Foods products. To ensure distributors market Reese Foods products vigorously in their
                                    respective areas of distribution, each distributor is expected to concentrate its marketing efforts in a particular
                                    geographic area. To encourage such effort, the individual Reese Foods distributors are typically granted exclusive
                                    distributorships in their areas. Defendants claim that to prevent potential free-rider  [**17]  problems 11 and to
                                    ensure distributors achieve economies of scale and other efficiencies in their respective markets, Reese has
                                    actively discouraged transhipping to other distributors.
                                    [**18]  These are objectives (sought to be achieved through non-price restraints)  [*623]  which defendants
                                    consider justifiable in the context of vertical distribution arrangements. According to plaintiffs, however, the history
                                    of Reese Foods is replete with horizontal attempts by distributors and shareholders to prevent other distributors
                                    from selling Reese Food products in their claimed geographic territories. The defendants' restrictive shareholders'
                                    agreement allegedly limits the methods by which Reese Foods members may distribute specialty food products.
                                    Defendants are thus allegedly able to charge more for Reese Foods products than they could if they distributed to
                                    the central warehouses of the same retail outlets.
                                    Fressie asserts that while the Bascom Food management contract with Reese Foods was in place, he ""voluntarily
                                    refrained from exercising [his] equal rights as a Reese shareholder to distribute Reese products to the retail trade
                                    for [his] own account and looked instead to the management contract as [his] primary source of income from the
                                    Bascom-Reese relationship."" Fressie Reply Cert., para. 1. With the termination of the management contract,
                                    however, he now seeks to exercise  [**19]  a right which he claims always existed under the shareholders
                                    agreement -- the right of all Reese Foods shareholders to buy Reese Foods products and to sell them as active
                                    distributors. Id.
                                    Defendants argue that, contrary to plaintiffs' assertions, shareholder status carries with it no vested right to
                                    purchase and resell Reese Foods products. They note that shareholders have been denied the opportunity to
                                    purchase Reese Foods products in the past. 12 It is further explained by defendants that, although Reese Foods
                                    11 In this context the term ""free-rider"" refers to a market imperfection which creates a disincentive for individual distributors to
                                    incur the costs of promoting a product and providing extensive service to the customer. Because another distributor might incur
                                    the expenses to promote the product and provide customer service, ""free riders"" are able to successfully sell the product, at a
                                    lesser cost, by enjoying the benefit of increased demand created by the efforts of others. Because of the free-rider effect, these
                                    services might not be provided by distributors in a purely competitive situation. See Posner, Antitrust Policy and the Supreme
                                    Court: An Analysis of the Restricted Distribution, Horizontal Merger and Potential Competition Decisions, 75 Columbia L. Rev.
                                    282, 285 n. 13 (1975); P. Samuelson, Economics 506-507 (10th ed. 1976). The free-rider problem was invoked as a justification
                                    for certain territorial restrictions in the landmark decision of Continental T.V., Inc. v. G.T.E. Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 55, 53 L.
                                    Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977), a case involving restraints in the context of vertical distribution arrangements.
                                    12 While plaintiffs argue stock ownership entitles the members of Reese Foods to sell Reese Foods products, there appears to
                                    be no dispute that termination of such rights may occur under certain defined circumstances which are set forth in the
                                    shareholders' agreement. In this connection, the stock of Irving Fien, a former shareholder/distributor, was repurchased by
                                    Reese Foods in 1976 because he was not selling a sufficient amount of Reese Food products to adequately support the Reese
                                    Foods product line. Inadequate sales is a specific ground set forth in the Reese Foods uniform shareholder agreement for
                                    715 F. Supp. 616, *622; 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7087, **15
                                    
                                    
                                    was formed by distributors who received stock in return for their contributions of capital, ""the informal connection
                                    between stock ownership and distributorship rights has broken down over the years."" Beers Aff. para. 7. Since the
                                    1980 decision not to require newly appointed distributors to become Reese Foods shareholders, new distributors of
                                    Reese Foods products have not been purchasers of Reese Foods stock. Id. Defendants argue that ownership of
                                    stock cannot imply a right to sell Reese Foods products, otherwise a distributor owning Reese Foods stock would
                                    be immune from being terminated. Id.
                                    [**20]  This argument, however, ignores the fact that the shareholder's agreement provides an affirmative
                                    obligation on the part of every shareholder to sell Reese Foods products. The unjustified refusal to sell Reese
                                    Foods products is a specific basis for Reese Foods to repurchase a member's stock. Fressie Reply Aff., para. 4.
                                    Moreover, Beers testified at a deposition that Reese Foods stock is ""really more of a membership card  [*624]  to
                                    the Reese buying co-op as opposed to representing a stock that someone would buy for an investment."" Beers
                                    Deposition at 69, 1. 15-19.
                                    Plaintiffs argue that Reese Foods has never refused to sell products to a shareholder other than pursuant to a
                                    justification contained in the shareholders' agreement. It has never merely taken the position that shareholders
                                    have no right to distribute. Fressie Reply, para. 7. From the evidence which has been submitted, it appears stock
                                    ownership in the Reese Foods cooperative carried with it an expectation that the stockholder would be a Reese
                                    Foods distributor, absent a violation of the shareholders' agreement or some unique reason such as stockholder
                                    management duties to the cooperative. There appears to be no other reason why an  [**21]  entity or person would
                                    hold stock in the cooperative.

                                    contractual distributors, but not to issue any new shares of stock in the corporation Fressie Reply Aff., para. 6.
                                    The following observation was made by a long-time attorney for Reese Foods: ""Until Reese's present exclusion of Fressie and
                                    Bascom, only three shareholders whose conduct transgressed the limitations imposed by the shareholder agreement had their
                                    right to purchase revoked and their shares repurchased by Reese. In each instance, the shareholder had violated the
                                    shareholder agreement by failing to sell a sufficient quantity of Reese products."" Bennett Cert., para. 10.
                                    Counsel for the defendants made an issue at oral argument of the fact that Reese Foods' former attorney has supplied evidence
                                    in support of plaintiffs' application for injunctive relief. After it was noted that any irregularities should be addressed now (rather
                                    than in connection with the inevitable appeal in this matter), all counsel for the defendants agreed that the evidence offered by
                                    Mr. Bennett (particularly his opinion that the distribution restraints constituted per se violations of the antitrust laws) was not
                                    critical to plaintiffs' present application. While the antitrust advice of counsel over a period of years might be relevant to the
                                    existence of a formal distribution policy, and notice to defendants of its possible illegality, such advice does not bear on the
                                    conclusions to be drawn in this matter.
                                    13 Moreover, while the burden rests upon the moving party to make these two requisite showings, a district court ""should take

                                    determination as to whether, under all the circumstances of the case, the restrictive practice imposes an

                                    On the issue of plaintiffs' likelihood of success on the merits, three primary issues are presented. First, a threshold
                                    issue exists concerning the existence of standing on the part of plaintiffs to bring this lawsuit. Second, an issue

                                    ] In determining the cross-elasticity of demand
                                    and interchangeability of use among various food products, the responsiveness of the sales of one product to price
                                    changes or supply of another must be weighed. See, SmithKline Corp., 427 F. Supp. 1089, 1115  [**31]  (E.D. Pa.
                                    1976).
                                    The availability of supply (of interchangeable goods) from various suppliers is a restraint on any producer of an item
                                    from increasing prices above the competitive level. Accordingly, as mentioned, the definition of a relevant market is
                                    based upon a determination of available substitutes.
                                    To define a market in product and geographic terms is to say that if prices were appreciably raised or volume
                                    appreciably curtailed for the product within a given area, while demand held constant, supply from other
                                    sources could not be expected to enter promptly enough and in large enough amounts to restore the old price
                                    or volume.

                                    16 Plaintiffs have claimed that the defendants have violated the Sherman Act by (1) agreeing to divide up territories on a
                                    horizontal basis and by (2) enforcing a group boycott against the plaintiffs. While it does not appear the success of plaintiffs' first
                                    claim necessarily depends upon the existence of dominant market power in various Reese Foods products, the success of the
                                    group boycott claim, under recent Supreme Court authority, would appear to require either market power in, or uniqueness of,
                                    various food products.

                                    the product in question. Likewise, cross-elasticity of supply is based upon the capability of other production facilities
                                    to produce a substitute product. The likelihood that similar products or production facilities are to be included in a
                                    relevant market increases in direct proportion to the increase  [**32]  of cross-elasticity or interchangeability of use
                                    of these products or facilities.
                                    In Brown Shoe, the Supreme Court spoke of the concept of submarkets within a relevant market. The Court
                                    identified ""practical indicia"" for delineation of sub-markets. Such indicia include ""industry or public recognition of the
                                    submarket as a separate economic entity, the product's peculiar characteristics and uses, unique production
                                    facilities, distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity to price changes and specialized vendors."" Brown Shoe, 370
                                    U.S. at 325. In this case, little evidence was offered to establish the relevant markets.
                                    On the issue of geographic markets, products of Reese Foods appear to be distributed primarily, if not exclusively,
                                    in the United States. While there has been no mention of distributors located overseas, however, Fressie did
                                    indicate that as part of his effort to promote the Reese Foods line he attended certain international food shows.
                                    On the issue of relevant market, it is not possible to make any hard and fast conclusions on the limited record in this
                                    case, which involves in excess of 500 individual products. If the outcome of this case depended  [*628]  upon the
                                    application  [**33]  of group boycott precedents (which, as discussed, requires certain market power or uniqueness
                                    with respect to a product before per se rules apply), it would have probably been necessary to conduct an
                                    evidentiary hearing into the characteristics of various Reese Foods products. A more detailed record would have to
                                    be developed if plaintiffs depended upon the boycott authorities.
                                    As to certain products (i.e., artichokes, cooking wines, capers and pasta), however, there has been significant
                                    evidence offered which tends to suggest the relevant product market is narrow because Reese Foods has unique
                                    packaging, customer loyalty and other characteristics. As indicated, several specialty food distributors, including
                                    some of the defendants, have stated in affidavits they need access to Reese Foods products because customers
                                    will accept no substitutes. Fressie analogized the difficulty of obtaining limited shelf space (at a grocery store) for
                                    alternative pastas (and other products) to the difficulty one would have in convincing a retailer to carry Fressie's
                                    coffee rather than Maxwell House coffee. He stated that, because of customer loyalty and recognition, the retailer
                                    would not accept  [**34]  Fressie's coffee at any price. Fressie Reply Cert., para. 5. Based on the affidavits supplied
                                    by several apparently disinterested specialty food distributors, which were largely uncontradicted, it appears that
                                    Reese Foods is a market force in at least certain products.
                                    III. Horizontal Restraints on Trade
                                    Plaintiffs argue the defendants have illegally agreed to restrict competition in the sale of Reese Foods products. As
                                    discussed, no Reese Foods distributor is permitted to sell to either wholesalers or to retail chain warehouses
                                    outside of the assigned territory. Fressie Aff. para. 21; Bennett Certification para. 44. Plaintiffs argue the
                                    defendants' practices, allegedly horizontal in nature, are illegal per se.
                                    On the threshold issue of whether the structure in this case is horizontal or vertical, plaintiffs argue the individual
                                    defendants, who are all involved in the distribution of food products at the same level, are also the present directors
                                    of Reese Foods. They control a voting trust of a majority of Reese Foods shares. Plaintiffs contend defendants,
                                    through Beers, their appointed chief executive officer, 17 have control over every aspect of Reese Foods' business.
                                    [**35]  In short, plaintiffs assert Reese Foods is simply an ""instrumentality"" of the defendants. Plaintiffs' Br., p. 21.
                                    Defendants, on the other hand, argue the structure and restrictions in this case are vertical in nature. It is noted
                                    Reese Foods does not itself compete as a distributor of any specialty food products. Rather, it is argued, Reese
                                    17 Plaintiffs argue that Beers, as the CEO, was simply hired to carry out the policies and directives of the horizontal competitors
                                    which comprise the Reese Foods Board of Directors. Complaint para. 38; Bennett Certification para. 38. The minutes of the
                                    March 21, 1988 Steering Committee meeting attached to Beers' affidavit state the reason Beers was selected to replace Fressie
                                    as Reese Foods' CEO was to insure: (i) ""the company will be accountable to the stockholders rather than the environment now
                                    where [Mr. Fressie] runs things the way he wants to;"" and (ii) ""[the company] is responsive to the distributors."" Id.

                                    Foods is a supplier of specialty food products to a variety of distributors, many of which happen to be the
                                    shareholders and founders of Reese Foods. It is asserted day-to-day operations and management decisions of
                                    Reese Foods  [**36]  are made by Beers, its chief executive, who is neither a Reese Foods shareholder nor a
                                    competitor of the individual distributors.
                                    Finally, defendants argue that, in his seventeen years of active participation in Reese Foods, Fressie has never
                                    functioned as a Reese Foods distributor to retail outlets. Arguing this case does not involve termination of ""an
                                    existing dealership,"" defendants emphasize plaintiffs have never distributed Reese Foods products for their own
                                    account. 18 Asserting the restrictive  [*629]  practices alleged by the plaintiffs are non-price distribution restraints,
                                    defendants argue the Supreme Court has made clear that all non-price vertical distribution restrictions are analyzed
                                    according to the rule of reason, rather than the per se rules of illegality (citing GTE Sylvania, supra, 433 U.S. at 59).
                                    For the following reasons, however, this case appears to involve restraints which are horizontal in nature.
                                    [**37]  This issue of horizontal restraints has been previously addressed by the Supreme Court. In United States v.
                                    Sealy, 388 U.S. 350, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238, 87 S. Ct. 1847 (1967), manufacturers of mattresses were licensed by Sealy
                                    to produce and sell products using the Sealy trademark. Sealy was owned almost entirely by its licensees who
                                    elected the board of directors and in fact controlled the business. Sealy agreed with its licensees not to license
                                    other manufacturers or sellers to sell Sealy-brand products in allocated territories in exchange for the promise of
                                    each licensee who sold in that territory not to expand beyond the area designated by Sealy. This was held to be a
                                    horizontal restraint, a per se violation of the Sherman Act.
                                    On the issue of whether the arrangement was horizontal or vertical, the court explained:
                                    The territorial arrangements must be regarded as the creature of horizontal action by the licensees. It would
                                    violate reality to treat them as equivalent to territorial limitations imposed by a manufacturer upon independent
                                    dealers as incident to the sale of a trade-marked product. Sealy, Inc. is an instrumentality of the licensees for
                                    purposes of the horizontal territorial allocation. It  [**38]  is not the principal.
                                    388 U.S. at 354 (emphasis added). The Court emphasized ""Sealy was a joint venture of, by and for its stockholder-
                                    licensees . . . and [they] are themselves directly, without even the semblance of insulation, in charge of Sealy's
                                    operations."" Id.; see also United States v. Topco Association, 405 U.S. 596, 608, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515, 92 S. Ct. 1126
                                    (1972).
                                    Plaintiffs argue Reese Foods, like Sealy, Inc., is simply an instrumentality of its shareholders. The shareholders,
                                    through the individual defendants' exercise of the power of the voting trust, have elected a new board of directors
                                    who are themselves competing Reese Foods distributors. In light of Sealy, the defendants' formalistic argument that
                                    Reese Foods (a mere ""instrumentality"" of the defendants) itself does not compete with the individual distributors is
                                    rejected.
                                    A more interesting question perhaps arises in light of the fact that Reese Foods has departed from its policy of only
                                    granting distributorships to the shareholders. It used to be the case that only shareholders were distributors, and all
                                    of them were. Currently, there are about ten distributors who do not own stock in Reese Foods. On the other hand,
                                    it appears that, with  [**39]  limited exceptions such as Fressie, all of the shareholders continue to be full line
                                    distributors of Reese Foods products. Indeed, as indicated above, the intention to distribute Reese Foods products
                                    is the only apparent reason to invest in Reese Foods.
                                    18 Fressie vigorously refutes the suggestion he has never functioned as a Reese Foods distributor. While he declined full
                                    distributorship status when he had his responsibilities and salary as CEO of Reese Foods, Fressie states that for approximately
                                    the past ten years, Bascom Food has sold Reese Foods products to specialty foods retail distributors in the New York
                                    metropolitan area and in other areas where adequate Reese Foods distributors could not be found. Bascom Food did this work
                                    for Reese Foods' account and turned the revenues over to Reese Foods. These sales, according to plaintiffs, have always been
                                    reflected in Reese Foods' gross sales. Fressie Reply Aff., para. 9.
                                    715 F. Supp. 616, *628; 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7087, **35
                                    
                                    
                                    The reason why the Supreme Court in Sealy concluded the arrangement was horizontal was because the Sealy
                                    licensees owned substantially all 19 of Sealy's stock.  [*630]  The point is that where the stock (or at least a
                                    significant portion of it) is not owned by independent third parties, it seems illogical to conclude that there exists a
                                    true vertical distribution arrangement, with arms-length sales of goods being made down the line of distribution.
                                    [**40]  As in Sealy, virtually all of the stock of Reese Foods is owned by the Reese Foods distributors. The fact
                                    which defendants appear to emphasize (although without any reasoned discussion of the rationale in Sealy) is that
                                    there now exists a substantial number of distributors who do not own stock in Reese Foods. This fact, however,
                                    does not suffice to convert the arrangement in this case to a vertical one. As to the distributors who do not own any
                                    stock in Reese Foods, the arrangement may well be characterized as vertical because these distributors are truly
                                    being supplied Reese Foods products by an independent third-party entity, over which they have no control. These
                                    entities, however, are not named as defendants in this lawsuit. As to the shareholder defendants who are also
                                    distributors, the arrangement appears decidely horizontal. These defendants, through their completely controlled
                                    instrumentality Reese Foods, appear to have eliminated competition at one level.
                                    HN13[
                                    ] Because it appears the arrangement among the parties in this case is horizontal, the next inquiry is
                                    whether the restraint involved here should be treated under the per se rule or under the rule of reason. 20  [**41]  It
                                    19 Another interesting issue would arise in the case where the distributors or licensees (horizontal competitors) owned less than
                                    ""substantially all"" of the stock of the purported ""instrumentality."" Where the horizontal competitors own all of the stock, they are
                                    one and the same with the licensor or cooperative entity and it must be concluded that no independent third party entity exists.
                                    Where lesser percentages of the stock are held by horizontal competitors, however, it begins to appear as though, at least to
                                    some degree, a bona fide third party exists which has an influence over the terms of the distribution arrangement, but which is
                                    not a horizontal competitor. In short, with less than complete ownership of the stock by horizontal competitors, the arrangement
                                    begins to develop vertical characteristics.
                                    An analogy to the antitrust doctrine articulated in Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Co., 467 U.S. 752, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628,
                                    104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984), might be made. While Copperweld held that parent corporations and wholly-owned subsidiaries (which
                                    have complete ""unities of interest"") are to be considered one and the same party for purposes of the two person requirement for
                                    a conspiracy, the Court specifically declined to address whether less than wholly-owned subsidiaries would be deemed to have
                                    similar ""unities of interest."" As in Copperweld, the issue here is whether Reese Foods should be considered one and the same
                                    as the individual distributors, with all parties sharing a ""unity of interest.""
                                    Since Copperweld, there has not been a conclusive answer to the question: To what extent do dilutions in percentage ownership
                                    of a subsidiary cause one to conclude there is no longer a unity of interest? Compare Magnum Force Distribs. v. Bon Bon Co. of
                                    Am., No. 84-2629 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 9, 1984) (holding, without discussion, that a parent and its 60% owned subsidiary were
                                    incapable of conspiring) with Comment, The Intra-Enterprise Conspiracy Doctrine After Copperweld Corp. v. Independence
                                    Tube Corp., 86 Colum. L. Rev. 198 (1986) (criticizing Magnum Force and arguing that a parent corporation and less than wholly-
                                    owned subsidiaries should not necessarily be viewed as one economic entity, and that a case by case approach should be
                                    adopted to determine whether parent companies and partially owned subsidiaries have a complete unity of interest).
                                    It appears that when a parent company owns less than all of the stock of a subsidiary, a closer examination must be made to
                                    determine whether a unity of interest exists. Similarly, it is suggested here that, in assessing whether an arrangement is vertical
                                    or horizontal, it is necessary to look more closely at Sealy-type entities when they are not entirely, or almost entirely, owned by
                                    the alleged horizontal competitors. An examination must be made, in particular, into whether an entity other than a horizontal
                                    competitor (or its affiliates) owns enough of the stock of the Sealy-type entity and actually exercises significant control over the
                                    terms of distribution.
                                    20 As indicated, plaintiffs argue the real motive for defendants' refusal to allow them to sell Reese Foods products is to prevent
                                    them from competing against defendants in the sale of Reese Foods products. It is alleged retailers and consumers are deprived
                                    of Reese Foods products at competitive prices because of defendants' horizontal agreements.
                                    To the extent it is concluded defendants' conduct in this case is governed by a per se analysis, an inquiry into their purported
                                    good motives would not be necessary. A brief discussion of the antitrust merits of this case under a rule of reason analysis is
                                    nonetheless set forth below. It is suggested that, if a rule of reason analysis were to be conclusive, further evidence would have
                                    to be adduced concerning, among other things, the need to enforce the territorial restrictions in a way that precludes Fressie
                                    from selling any Reese Foods products.
                                    715 F. Supp. 616, *629; 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7087, **39
                                    
                                    
                                    is argued by plaintiffs that the facts of this case are essentially identical to the facts in Topco, supra. The Topco
                                    Court held horizontal anticompetitive conduct (involving the division of customer territories), like that engaged in by
                                    defendants, to be per se unlawful under section one of the Sherman Act.
                                    [**42]  Topco Assoc., Inc. (""Topco Associates"") was a cooperative association of approximately  [*631]  twenty-five
                                    small and medium sized regional supermarkets. Topco Associates, like Reese Foods, was owned and operated by
                                    its members. The member firms, apart from their affiliation with Topco Associates, were wholly independent,
                                    separate supermarket chains, each operating under independent management. The basic function of Topco
                                    Associates was to serve as a purchasing agent for its members. Topco Associates procured and distributed high
                                    quality merchandise under private labels which it sold to its members. Topco Associates did not itself own any
                                    manufacturing, processing or warehousing facilities. The board of directors, which controlled the operation of the
                                    association, was drawn from the members and elected the association's officers, including its CEO. 405 U.S. at

                                    In an action brought by the United States for injunctive relief against alleged violation by Topco Associates of
                                    section one of the Sherman Act, the Government alleged that there existed:
                                    a continuing agreement, understanding and concert of action among the co-conspirator member firms acting
                                    through Topco, the substantial terms  [**43]  of which have been and are that each co-conspirator or member
                                    firm will sell Topco-controlled brands only within the marketing territory allocated to it, and will refrain from
                                    selling Topco-controlled brands outside such marketing territory.

                                    The Supreme Court stated:
                                    HN14[
                                    ] One of the classic examples of a per se violation of § 1 is an agreement between competitors at the
                                    same level of the market structure to allocate territories in order to minimize competition. Such concerted action
                                    is usually termed a ""horizontal"" restraint, in contradistinction to combinations of persons at different levels of
                                    the market structure, e.g., manufacturers and distributors, which are termed ""vertical"" restraints. This Court
                                    reiterated time and time again that HN15[
                                    ] ""horizontal territorial limitations . . . are naked restraints of trade

                                    738, 746, 83 S. Ct. 696 (1963). Such limitations are per se violations of the Sherman Act.
                                    405 U.S. at 608 (other citations omitted). The Supreme Court held:
                                    We think that it is clear that the restraint in this case is a horizontal one, and, therefore,  [**44]  a per se
                                    violation of § 1.
                                    Id. The Court rejected the defendants' attempts to justify the restrictions, holding that they were illegal per se, and
                                    that purported benefits to competition would not be considered.
                                    Apparently because it would be unavailing to try to distinguish Topco on the facts, the defendants have argued that
                                    it is essentially outdated precedent. Defendants argue that the rule of reason is the prevailing standard of analysis
                                    today and cite GTE Sylvania, supra, 433 U.S. at 49 (approving non-price vertical restraints under the rule of reason
                                    where restrictions on intrabrand competition were beneficially offset by promotion of interbrand competition).
                                    Defendants have also cited cases involving horizontal arrangements which were treated under the rule of reason
                                    analysis.
                                    In National Collegiate Athletic Assoc. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Oklahoma, 468 U.S. 85, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70, 104

                                    broadcasters, created a horizontal restraint -- an agreement among competitors on  [**45]  the way in which they
                                    would compete with one another. The per se rule was held inapplicable because more in-depth analysis was
                                    required to determine whether restraints on the number of NCAA football games were essential for the joint product

                                    These cases, which did involve horizontal restrictions among competitors, depended on the fact that a new product
                                    was being offered pursuant to a restrictive arrangement, or that a product would probably not exist in the same form
                                    without the horizontal arrangement. No such new product flows from the arrangement between Reese Foods and
                                    the individual defendants. Defendants  [**46]  have argued that Reese Foods, through its distributor network,
                                    provides consumers with an alternative high-quality specialty food line which has many substitutes. Defendants' Br.,
                                    p. 6. It has not been demonstrated that various Reese Foods products would not be sold other than pursuant to the
                                    distribution restrictions.
                                    While there does appear to be a trend toward treating certain horizontal arrangements under the rule of reason
                                    analysis, this case appears to be directly controlled by Topco. The horizontal cases cited by defendants in favor of a
                                    rule of reason approach -- BMI and NCAA -- cite Topco approvingly. The Supreme Court has never indicated an
                                    intent to overrule Topco. While one court has apparently questioned the continued viability of Topco, 22 the
                                    Supreme Court has recently provided an indication that Topco continues to be good law. Last term, the Court
                                    restated the well-established principle that:
                                    [A] HN16[
                                    ] horizontal agreement to divide territories is per se illegal.
                                    [**47]  Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 108 S. Ct. 1515, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808
                                    (1988) and cited Topco as authority. To the extent the Supreme Court has ever intended to modify the breadth or
                                    application of Topco, a somewhat less encompassing restatement of the Topco principle would be expected. See
                                    also United States v. Cooperative Theatres of Ohio, 845 F.2d 1367 (6th Cir. 1988).
                                    Defendants' attempt to lightly disregard Supreme Court authorities on point is rejected. Neither Sealy nor Topco
                                    have been held to be no longer applicable in this Circuit. Defendants' agreement to divide territories and to restrict
                                    competition with the assigned territories appears to be illegal per se.
                                    Plaintiffs have also alleged defendants' practices constitute an illegal group boycott which should be treated as a
                                    per se violation of section one of the Sherman Act. The boycott is allegedly the means by which the defendants,
                                    who are food distributors at the same horizontal level of the specialty foods market, have enforced the allocation of
                                    territorial markets among themselves and have made unlawful agreements on terms and conditions for distributing
                                    Reese Foods specialty food products.  [**48]  Plaintiffs assert defendants are engaged in a classic group boycott of
                                    plaintiffs by enforcing these restraints and preventing plaintiffs from competing with defendants in the sale of Reese

                                    Group boycotts have historically been held to be among those categories of conduct deemed unreasonable per se
                                    because they are so likely to restrict competition without any offsetting efficiency gains. See United States v.

                                    that:
                                    21 In BMI, the Supreme Court recognized that the defendants were offering a product -- the monitoring and enforcement against
                                    unauthorized copyright use -- which would be difficult and expensive for the copyright owners to substitute if the defendants
                                    were prohibited from engaging in the cooperative practice.

                                    Defendants argue the rule of reason approach has been endorsed in recent cases involving certain concerted
                                    refusals to deal. See, e.g., Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery & Printing Co., 472 U.S. 284,
                                    86 L. Ed. 2d 202, 105 S. Ct. 2613 (1985). Noting that certain efficiencies might be obtained by forming a purchasing
                                    cooperative (from which the plaintiff was excluded), the Supreme Court explained that:
                                    Wholesale purchasing cooperatives such as Northwest are not a form of concerted activity characteristically
                                    likely to result in predominantly anticompetitive effects. Rather, such cooperative arrangements would seem to
                                    be designed to increase economic efficiency and render markets more, rather than less, competitive. The
                                    arrangement permits the participating retailers to achieve economies of scale in both the purchase and
                                    warehousing of wholesale supplies, and also ensures ready access to a stock  [**50]  of goods that might
                                    otherwise be unavailable on short notice. . . . [This allows members] to compete more effectively with large
                                    retailers.
                                    472 U.S. at 295 (citations omitted). The Court did conclude, however, that per se treatment may be appropriate
                                    under certain circumstances, i.e., if the plaintiff establishes that the cooperative possessed market power or that
                                    access to the cooperative is essential for effective competition because a unique product is involved. Id. at 296-97.
                                    In this case Fressie has made a substantial showing (which, of course, is subject to further rebuttal at trial) that
                                    certain, if not all, Reese Foods products are unique and that he will be unable to effectively compete in the specialty
                                    food business, in several different product lines, without access to products distributed by Reese Foods.
                                    Defendants merely assert, without compelling support, that there are numerous substitutes for Reese Foods
                                    products, Beers Aff., paras. 4, 6, and the wide array of competing substitutes demonstrates that the distributorship
                                    opportunities for plaintiffs are innumerable. Defendants' Br., p. 6.
                                    Fressie, on the other hand, corroborates in detail his assertion  [**51]  that Reese Foods products are unique and
                                    necessary if he and Bascom Food are to compete effectively in the sale of specialty food products. It is asserted
                                    Reese Foods is a dominant line of uniquely branded specialty food items that is virtually impossible to replace. This
                                    alleged fact is attested to by not only Fressie, but also by non-party retailers and specialty food distributors who
                                    have filed certifications in this case.
                                    Among the non-party businessmen in the specialty food industry who have submitted certifications in this matter,
                                    Joseph Michael of F & G Food Distributors has stated: ""Reese products have done very well in our market. Their
                                    quality makes them attractive, particularly to our upper income consumers. There are no adequate substitutes
                                    available to me for some of the Reese product line, particularly Reese artichoke hearts and its cooking wines.""
                                    Michael Cert., para. 3 (emphasis added). Similarly, Leo A. Dick, President of Leo A. Dick & Sons, has stated:
                                    ""There are some Reese products which are virtually impossible to substitute such as Honey Cins, devilled olives,
                                    and sassafras tea bags."" Dick Cert., para. 2 (emphasis added). Mr. Koons another specialty foods  [**52]
                                    businessman, tried to substitute other specialty food products  [*634]  for those of Reese Foods, but found that
                                    these are not comparable and that many of his customers would not accept such products as a substitute for those
                                    sold by Reese. Koons Cert., para. 4.
                                    As one of his primary examples of why plaintiffs cannot duplicate the Reese Foods' private label products (because
                                    in many instances they dominate the specialty food industry with a brand recognition, breadth of coverage and

                                    consumer loyalty), Fressie emphasizes that DaVinci pasta is both unique and the most popular brand of imported
                                    Italian pasta in this country. The DaVinci brand name has supermarket authorizations, established customer loyalty
                                    and is sold exclusively through Reese Foods distributors. Each order allegedly takes approximately three months to
                                    fill. Because DaVinci pasta has brand name recognition and customer loyalty, it cannot be replaced by another
                                    brand. Fressie Reply Cert., paras. 2-5. As far as artichoke hearts are concerned, Fressie states:
                                    I cannot market a ""Bascom"" Brand of artichoke hearts and compete with the defendants and the other Reese
                                    shareholders/distributors in the sale of Reese artichoke hearts.  [**53]  Supermarkets have a finite amount of
                                    shelf space. Warehouses, stockrooms and inventory management systems are set up to handle a finite
                                    number of products. Reese products have substantial good will in the form of brand loyalty, supermarket
                                    authorizations and warehouse and inventory clearances which would take anyone starting up a new private
                                    label line of products literally years and millions of dollars to achieve.
                                    Id., para. 3. In addition, Fressie claims:
                                    it would take me literally years of marketing effort to get my ""Fressie"" coffee on the supermarket shelves next to
                                    the ""Maxwell House"" coffee regardless of what price I would be willing to charge.
                                    Id., para. 5.
                                    Fressie also claims, as a related concept, that in many other products such as smoked oysters and capers, Reese
                                    Foods is the ""dominant market factor."" Having spent his entire career in this line of products, plaintiffs assert
                                    Fressie is known throughout the industry as ""Mr. Reese."" Koons Cert., para. 6. It is claimed that if plaintiffs are
                                    denied access to these products, defendants will succeed in placing plaintiffs, as competitors, at a severe
                                    competitive disadvantage.
                                    In light of the substantial allegations  [**54]  concerning the uniqueness of various Reese Foods products and the
                                    related market power held by the defendants in these product lines, this case appears to be covered by the
                                    exception articulated by the Supreme court (as per se unlawful refusals to deal) in Northwest Wholesale Stationers,
                                    Inc. 23 Even if, with respect to certain product lines, Reese Foods does not offer a truly unique product, plaintiffs
                                    note that the resource denied in an alleged group boycott does not have to be ""indispensable"" -- only competitively
                                    significant. See Associated Press v. United States, 326 U.S. 1, 17-18, 89 L. Ed. 2013, 65 S. Ct. 1416 (1945). 24
                                    While it is not critical to resolve whether this case involves a group boycott which should be considered under per
                                    se analysis (because it appears the facts in this case indicate an illegal division of market share by horizontal
                                    competitors, under Topco), it is noted that this case appears to constitute the type of boycott to be treated under per
                                    se analysis.
                                    [**55]
                                    If this case were to be treated under a rule of reason analysis, it would be necessary to consider the nature of the
                                    restraint (non-price, territorial restrictions) and the  [*635]  purported pro-competitive justification for it. The Supreme
                                    Court has previously considered the justifications for distributions restrictions in specified territories.
                                    In GTE Sylvania, supra, the Supreme Court refused to extend per se illegality to vertical nonprice restraints. That
                                    case involved a manufacturer's termination of one dealer pursuant to an exclusive territory agreement with another.
                                    The Court further concluded that HN18[
                                    ] vertical nonprice restraints had not been shown to have such a
                                    23 Several courts have indicated ""classic"" group boycotts remain subject to the per se rule. See Zimmerman v. Pepsico, Inc., 836
                                    F.2d 173, 183 (3d Cir. 1988); Charley's Taxi Radio Dispatch Corp. v. SIDA of Hawaii, Inc., 810 F.2d 869, 877-878 (9th Cir.
                                    1987); Goss v. Memorial Hospital System, 789 F.2d 353, 354-355 (5th Cir. 1986); Seaboard Supply Co. v. Congoleum Corp.,
                                    770 F.2d 367, 374 (3d Cir. 1985)
                                    24 As an additional argument why Reese Foods products are competitively significant, Fressie has explained that many
                                    customers will not buy non-Reese Foods products from a distributor who does not carry Reese Foods products as well. Some
                                    customers will prefer to deal with a single distributor which carries all product lines.

                                    The Court found that the territorial restrictions had real potential to stimulate inter brand competition, ""the primary
                                    concern of antitrust law"", 433 U.S. at 52, n. 19. It explained:
                                    ""New manufacturers and manufacturers entering new markets can use the restrictions in order to induce
                                    competent and aggressive retailers to make the kind of investment of capital and labor that is often required in
                                    the distribution of products unknown to the consumer. Established manufacturers can use them to induce
                                    retailers to engage in promotional activities or to provide service and repair facilities necessary to the efficient
                                    marketing of their products. Service and repair are vital for many products. . . . The availability and quality of
                                    such services affect a manufacturer's goodwill and the competitiveness of his product. Because the market
                                    imperfections such as the so-called 'free-rider' effect, these services might not be provided by retailers in a
                                    purely competitive situation, despite the fact that each retailer's benefit would be greater if all provided the
                                    services than if none did.""

                                    The Court observed that a rule of per se illegality for vertical  [**57]  nonprice restraints 25 was not needed or
                                    effective to protect intra brand competition. As long as interbrand competition existed, that would provide a
                                    ""significant check"" on any attempt to exploit intrabrand market power. Further, the per se illegality of vertical
                                    restraints would create an artificial and perhaps undesirable incentive for manufacturers to integrate vertically. Id. at
                                    57, n. 26.
                                    The nature of the restraints in this case (nonprice territory restrictions), as well as the asserted procompetitive
                                    justifications, are similar to those addressed by the Supreme Court in GTE Sylvania. The key difference between
                                    the cases is that GTE Sylvania involved vertical restrictions, and that was an important reason for applying the rule
                                    of reason analysis. If it is assumed  [**58]  merely for discussion purposes that the rule of reason applies in this
                                    case (which, as indicated above, is not the holding here), GTE Sylvania would provide persuasive guidance in
                                    analyzing the competitive impact of territory restrictions.
                                    While Reese Foods customers may not need the extensive service and repair desired by the electronics customers
                                    in GTE Sylvania, it appears that vigorous advertising and promotion of specialty food products would indeed
                                    enhance inter brand competition. Before concluding (for discussion purposes) that the restrictions in this case
                                    promote inter brand competition more than they eliminate intra brand competition, however, it would probably be
                                    necessary to conduct evidentiary hearings to adduce certain evidence. First, if it were concluded after a hearing that
                                    certain Reese Foods products were so completely unique, it would appear as though there would exist no inter
                                    brand competition to be enhanced. As to such unique products, the territory restrictions would have the effect of
                                    eliminating intra brand competition and, perhaps, the only competition. If  [*636]  this were the case, the rationale of
                                    GTE Sylvania would seem inapplicable and the restraints  [**59]  would be deemed unreasonable.
                                    Second, it would perhaps be necessary to explore at trial the purported justifications for refusing to sell food
                                    products to the plaintiffs. While the territorial restrictions may be pro-competitive generally (at least as to some
                                    products), the exclusion of plaintiffs from the markets may have no legitimate justification whatsoever. It was
                                    suggested above that the reasons for terminating Fressie and Bascom Food appear pretextual. At trial it would
                                    perhaps be necessary to consider the reasons why Fressie should not be granted his own geographic territory,
                                    assuming territorial restrictions were upheld under the rule of reason.
                                    IV. Irreparable Harm
                                    25 GTE Sylvania noted an important distinction between vertical nonprice and vertical price restraints. There was support for the
                                    proposition that vertical price restraints reduce inter brand price competition because they ""'facilitate cartelizing.'"" Id. at 51, n. 18.
                                    There does not appear to be a similar danger of the cartel-facilitating effect resulting from vertical nonprice restraints.
                                    715 F. Supp. 616, *635; 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7087, **55
                                    
                                    
                                    Before preliminary injunctive relief will be issued, plaintiffs must demonstrate they will suffer irreparable harm
                                    without it. The Third Circuit has consistently held that HN19[
                                    ] preliminary injunctive relief is not available where
                                    money damages are adequate to compensate the injured party. See Frank's GMC Truck Center, Inc. v. General
                                    Motors Corp., 847 F.2d 100, 102-03 (3d Cir. 1988); In Re Arthur Treacher's Franchisee Litigation, 689 F.2d 1137,
                                    1146-47 (3d Cir. 1982).
                                    In Frank's GMC, a case not arising  [**60]  under the antitrust laws, 26 the plaintiff had been a GM franchisee for
                                    fifty years and had been a ""full line"" distributor for fifteen years. It had a substantial history as a distributor which is
                                    apparently what made it possible to calculate the amount of future lost profits attributable to its discontinuance as a
                                    heavy-duty truck distributor. The Third Circuit concluded there was no irreparable harm where the terminated
                                    product accounted for 26.5% of gross profits. 847 F.2d at 102-03.
                                    [**61]  The Third Circuit noted the district court expressly doubted that there was irreparable harm, but
                                    nevertheless granted injunctive relief based on equitable considerations. The Third Circuit held this to be a clear
                                    error and an insufficient basis upon which to grant injunctive relief where the applicant had an adequate remedy at
                                    law, in that case money damages. 847 F.2d at 102 n. 3. In Frank's GMC the Third Circuit did not exclude from
                                    future consideration the possibility that, under certain circumstances, it would be difficult, or indeed impossible, to
                                    calculate the amount of lost profits.
                                    Defendants have cited several cases where it was held that irreparable harm did not exist because a specific
                                    amount of lost revenues (measured as a percentage) could be calculated. See Inland Printing Co. v. A.B. Dick Co.,
                                    Bus. Franchise Guide (CCH) P 8997 at 18,318 (W.D. Mo. 1987) (no irreparable harm where sales represented
                                    approximately 20% of total sales and profits); Crowley Beverage Co. v. Miller Brewing Co., Bus. Franchise Guide
                                    (CCH) P 8383 at 15,368 (D.Minn. 1985) (no irreparable injury where terminated products accounted for 45% of
                                    commercial sales); O.M. Droney Beverage  [**62]  Co. v. Miller Brewing Co., 365 F. Supp. 1067, 1068-71 (D.Minn.
                                    1973) (no irreparable harm where sales of terminated  [*637]  products represented a majority of distributor's
                                    business).
                                    It is clear that under Frank's GMC, irreparable harm does not exist, from a monetary point of view, if the amount of
                                    lost revenues can be reduced to a dollar amount. Without attacking that unequivocal rule articulated in Frank's
                                    GMC, plaintiffs argue that ample authority (although none of it particularly recent) exists for concluding
                                    inestimatable harm exists in this case.
                                    In Bergen Drug Co. v. Parke, Davis & Co., 307 F.2d 725 (3d Cir. 1962), the defendants terminated plaintiff as a
                                    distributor of defendant's drug products after plaintiff brought an antitrust action alleging discriminatory dealing and
                                    an attempt to monopolize. The Third Circuit concluded plaintiff's damages were incalculable. Recognizing that
                                    pharmacies prefer to deal with a full-line, full-service wholesaler who can meet all of their needs in one order, the
                                    Court stated:
                                    It would be impossible to estimate or compute plaintiff's damages for the loss of good will which it will suffer as
                                    a result of being unable to provide its retail  [**63]  customers with service at least equally as good as that
                                    26 It has been suggested that Frank's GMC should not apply with full force in this case because this case involves antitrust
                                    issues, which are somehow of greater public concern. While the public interest is a factor to be considered in granting injunctive
                                    relief, Arthur Treachers, 689 F.2d at 1143, it has been stated that in determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction under
                                    the antitrust laws, ""there is nothing exceptional by reason of the presence of antitrust elements; the normal principles of equity
                                    are applicable."" Amigo Gift Ass'n v. Executive Properties, Ltd., 588 F. Supp. 654, 657 (W.D. Mo. 1984) (citing Kay Instrument
                                    Sales Co. v. Haldex Aktiebolag, 296 F. Supp. 578, 579 (S.D.N.Y. 1968)).
                                    It has been concluded that defendants' apparent conduct in this matter, if it can be proved at trial, constitutes a violation of the
                                    Sherman Act and asserted justifications for the conduct will not be considered under the rule of reason analysis. It is noted that
                                    the existence of a per se violation of the antitrust laws appears to bear on the other criteria (i.e., in addition to the likelihood of
                                    success on the merits) for a preliminary injunction. For example, on the issue of the public interest, discussed below, it is surely
                                    in the public interest to prevent per se violations of the law.
                                    715 F. Supp. 616, *636; 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7087, **59
                                    
                                    
                                    furnished by other wholesalers who have a continuing access to defendant's products. Goods supplied to it by
                                    defendant are not otherwise available. . . . But the record fails to show that plaintiff could purchase such
                                    products under the same terms that it had purchased them from defendant.
                                    Id. at 728. Similarly, in Jacobson & Co. Inc. v. Armstrong Cork Co., 548 F.2d 438 (2d Cir. 1977), the Second Circuit
                                    affirmed the trial court's finding that
                                    loss of the Armstrong line would jeopardize Jacobson's good will and create a risk of ""immeasurable harm""
                                    should Jacobson's customers and potential customers turn to competitors who do sell Armstrong products.
                                    [The trial judge] also concluded that the competitive disadvantage at which Jacobson would be placed were it
                                    unable to bid Armstrong products was neither calculable nor compensable in dollars and cents.
                                    Id. at 444-445. The Second Circuit agreed that plaintiff presented ample evidence to show a threatened loss of
                                    good will and customers, both present and potential, neither of which could be rectified by monetary damages. Id.
                                    In Blackwelder Furniture Co. v. Seilig  [**64]  Manufacturing Co., Inc., 550 F.2d 189 (4th Cir. 1977), the court
                                    explained:
                                    
                                    We view the trial court's finding that Blackwelder will suffer no irreparable harm (on the basis that any injury to
                                    it would be readily calculable and collectible) as clearly erroneous. Blackwelder's past profits 27 on Seilig
                                    furniture afford a plausible basis for calculating some of the damages from any wrongful termination. But not
                                    all. Word-of-mouth grumbling of customers can convert Blackwelder's inability to honor Seilig orders into a
                                    reputation for general unreliability as a merchant. The harm posed to Blackwelder's general goodwill by its
                                    inability to fill outstanding and accumulating orders in excess of $ 15,000 for furniture listed in its catalogues is
                                    incalculable -- not incalculably great or small, just incalculable.

                                    customer loyalty and private ""Shop-Rite"" label."").
                                    In this case, although Fressie has been closely involved with the promotion of Reese Foods products over a period
                                    of several years, he has never been a fully active distributor of Reese Foods products. Prior to oral argument, no
                                    suggestion had been offered as to how plaintiffs, if they succeed in proving their antitrust claims at trial, can prove
                                    the actual amount of damages suffered as a result of not cultivating a potential customer base. Also, it appears a
                                    victory at trial could be empty if damages are not calculable; at the time of  [**66]  trial the opportunity to do
                                    business may well be gone.
                                    In an effort to demonstrate that damages can be calculated even without a prior sales history, defendants submitted
                                    -- without leave from the court -- a letter quoting from an Eighth Circuit opinion and attaching an article (Rulon,
                                    Proof of Damages for Terminated or Precluded Plaintiffs, 49 ABA Antitrust Law Journal 153, 159-63 (Summer
                                    1980) (""Rulon"")) which discusses possible methods by which terminated or precluded plaintiffs can prove their
                                    damages. First,  in Central Telecommunications Inc. v. TCI Cablevision Inc., 800 F.2d 711, 727-732 (8th Cir. 1986),
                                    cert. denied, 480 U.S. 910, 94 L. Ed. 2d 528, 107 S. Ct. 1358 (1987), the trial court held that the plaintiff, an
                                    unestablished business, unlawfully precluded from the market, was entitled to recover actual antitrust damages.
                                    The Court of Appeals affirmed, noting:
                                    27 As discussed, neither Fressie nor Bascom Food have a lengthy history of operations which can be referred to in an attempt to
                                    measure the loss of revenues due to the defendants' refusal to deal.
                                    715 F. Supp. 616, *637; 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7087, **63
                                    
                                    
                                    * * * at least seven of the Circuit Courts of Appeal, as well as numerous district courts, and the Supreme Court
                                    by implication have ruled that an unestablished business can recover future lost profits under the federal
                                    antitrust laws if a sufficiently advanced state of preparation for entering the market has been achieved.
                                    Id.  [**67]  at 727-28. Defendants rely on the above passage as support for their position that plaintiffs, who have
                                    an adequate opportunity to prove actual damages at trial, should not be granted injunctive relief. This is an unduly
                                    broad reading of Central Telecommunications, which did not involve the propriety of an injunction or discuss the
                                    issue of calculating damages (in terms of specific methods) in connection with the antitrust discussion. 28
                                    Central Telecommunications stands for the proposition that a plaintiff, if it has achieved a sufficiently advanced
                                    state of preparation for entering a market, may as a legal matter be entitled to recover anticipated profits. There is a
                                    difference between saying a precluded competitor is entitled to recover anticipated profits on the one hand and
                                    concluding that those damages are so readily calculable that an injunction should not be issued on the other hand.
                                    Central Telecommunications quoted from Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 23 L. Ed.
                                    2d 129, 89 S. Ct. 1562 (1969) where the Court  [**68]  held that antitrust damages could be awarded on the basis
                                    of plaintiff's estimates of sales it would have made absent the violation:
                                    Damage issues in these cases are rarely susceptible of the kind of concrete, detailed proof of injury which is
                                    available in other contexts. The Court has repeatedly held that in the absence of more precise proof, the fact-
                                    finder may ""conclude as a matter of just and reasonable inference from the proof of defendants' wrongful acts
                                    and their tendency to injure plaintiffs' business, and from the evidence of the decline in prices, profits and
                                    values, not shown to be attributable to other causes, that defendants' wrongful acts had caused damage to the
                                    plaintiffs.""
                                    Id. at 123-24. That case, however, did not involve a brand new competitor which was precluded from a market.
                                    Zenith Radio does not support the argument that an injunction should not issue in this case because Fressie will
                                    have an adequate opportunity to approximate damages later.
                                    [*639]  Second, defendants have submitted the above-mentioned article which purportedly demonstrates the
                                    availability of methods for proving damages, in the form of lost profits, suffered by terminated distributors.  [**69]  In
                                    fact, however, the article suggests that the two methods discussed are not easily applied to plaintiffs without
                                    operating histories. The author stated that:
                                    Going-concern [method (the first method of calculating damages)] is of little utility to a plaintiff who has been
                                    precluded from entering into a business. Lacking both an enterprise and a track record on which to base a
                                    valuation, a plaintiff in this predicament generally seeks to measure its damages by establishing the loss of
                                    anticipated or future profits occasioned by the antitrust violation.
                                    * * * *
                                    There are two generally recognized methods of proving loss of profits: (1) the ""before and after"" theory; and (2)
                                    the ""yardstick"" test. The ""before and after"" theory compares the plaintiff's profit record prior to the violation with
                                    its record after the violation. This method is of limited utility to a precluded or terminated plaintiff who has been
                                    prevented from compiling an earnings record sufficient to allow an estimation of his loss of profits. Plaintiffs in
                                    this situation sometimes turn to the ""yardstick"" test under which the earnings of the foreclosed or destroyed
                                    business are measured by the earnings realized by comparable  [**70]  businesses. 29 However, since the
                                    calculation of lost profits under this method is based on actual earnings, only profits lost between the time of
                                    the violation and the time of ultimate judgment in the case can be recovered. This does not provide the
                                    28 The issue of proving damages, in particular those which were purported to be speculative, was discussed in connection with
                                    certain state law claims.
                                    29 Plaintiffs in this case have argued that there are not really comparable specialty food distributors of Reese Foods products.
                                    Fressie claims that he is ""Mr. Reese"" and that he has the most goodwill after devoting nearly two decades to promoting Reese
                                    Foods products.
                                    715 F. Supp. 616, *638; 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7087, **66
                                    
                                    
                                    terminated or precluded plaintiff with the full measure of damages he generally seeks, the profits that would
                                    have been forthcoming over the projected life of the business.
                                    Rulon at 159-60 (footnotes omitted).
                                    Plaintiffs here have no record of sales or profits from the active distribution of Reese Foods products to the retail
                                    class of trade from which an approximation of future lost sales or profits could be calculated or extrapolated. This
                                    case, in short, is distinguishable from Frank's GMC where there existed a fifteen year history of sales activities.
                                    Moreover, on an issue somewhat distinct from the precise amount of lost sales, the case law affords HN20[
                                    ]
                                    injunctive  [**71]  relief to plaintiffs whose loss of consumer good will results in incalculable damage. In this case
                                    plaintiffs assert they will suffer an inestimable loss of good will as a result of their inability to purchase unique Reese
                                    Foods products from any other source. They will be unable to satisfy present and future customers' orders (the
                                    amount of which is not determinable without an operating history) for Reese Foods products. This denial of access
                                    to Reese Foods goods, and the resultant harm caused to plaintiffs, cannot be calculated or adequately
                                    compensated in money damages.
                                    As to the existence of good will, although there is no specific customer list, Fressie asserts that he possesses vast
                                    knowledge of the market for Reese Foods specialty food products. For seventeen years, he has vigorously
                                    promoted the various Reese Foods brands and Reese Foods products. 30 He has travelled extensively,  [*640]
                                    both internationally and in this country, attending food shows, product demonstrations, conventions and countless
                                    other events to support and build up the Reese Foods line and Bascom Food's association with it. He has
                                    developed extensive and valuable contacts with suppliers and customers, both actual  [**72]  and potential, for
                                    Reese Foods products. If he is not permitted access to Reese Foods products, Fressie claims his suppliers and
                                    customers will dissipate, at incalculable cost to him and to his reputation in the specialty foods industry. Fressie Aff.,
                                    para. 11.
                                    It is recognized that the standard for demonstrating irreparable harm is a difficult one in the Third Circuit. Frank's
                                    [**73]  GMC stands for the proposition that, without a demonstration of why losses cannot be calculated,
                                    irreparable harm does not exist. ""What may constitute irreparable harm in a particular case is, of course, dependent
                                    upon the particular circumstances of the case."" Hohe v. Casey, 868 F.2d 69, 71 (3d Cir. 1989) (citing Oburn v.
                                    Shapp, 521 F.2d 142, 151 (3d Cir. 1975)). It has been concluded that plaintiffs have demonstrated an inability to
                                    prove the likely amount of lost profits and that their good will would suffer in inestimable amounts.
                                    Even if this case were not distinguishable from Frank's GMC on the foregoing basis, this case appears to involve a
                                    form of non-economic harm which some courts have recognized. Fressie had spent most of his working life in the
                                    specialty foods industry, with at least seventeen years being devoted to Reese Foods products in particular. Even if
                                    he could be financially compensated for the losses he would suffer from being expelled from his livelihood, he could
                                    not be relieved from the harm resulting from the potential destruction of his life's work.
                                    While there may not exist Third Circuit precedent for preventing this type of irreparable  [**74]  injury, this case
                                    provides a compelling example of how not all things in life can be reduced to a dollar price. Even if the financial
                                    losses suffered by plaintiffs could be calculated in this case -- although no persuasive suggestion has been made
                                    how that could be done -- a preliminary injunction should be issued pursuant to the thoughtful reasoning contained
                                    in an opinion written by Judge Friendly. He noted that, in a case involving the termination of an automobile dealer,
                                    ""the right to continue a business in which William Semmes had engaged for twenty years and into which his son
                                    30 Defendants have argued that, where a distributor sells a product for only a short time prior to its termination, the distributor's
                                    damages are not so uncertain as to constitute irreparable harm. (Citing Jack Kahn Music v. Baldwin Piano & Organ, Inc., 604
                                    F.2d 755, 759 (2d Cir. 1979) (dealership terminated after one and a half years; preliminary injunction denied because dealership

                                    On the issue of the public interest, the court explained in Paschall v. K.C. Star Co., 441 F. Supp. 349 (W.D.Mo.
                                    1977) that:

                                    ] Consideration of the public interest is particularly appropriate in the context of a private antitrust suit
                                    where injunctive  [**75]  relief is sought. In Zenith Radio Corporation v. Hazeltine Research, 395 U.S. 100, 130-
                                    31, 89 S. Ct. 1562, 1580, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129, 152 (1969), it is declared:
                                    The purpose of giving private parties treble damages and injunctive remedies was not merely to provide
                                    private relief, but was to serve as well the high purpose of enforcing the antitrust laws.
                                    If it should appear in the trial on the merits, that defendant has transgressed the federal antitrust laws, to term
                                    plaintiffs' injuries compensable in money and deny injunctive relief, thereby allowing continuation of violation of
                                    the antitrust laws would be highly inappropriate. While satisfying the pocketbook interests of the individual
                                    plaintiffs, it would do little to protect the public.
                                    Id. at 359.
                                    Finally, as far as the balancing of hardships is concerned, Reese Foods argues it will suffer serious injury if a
                                    preliminary injunction is ordered. It is claimed that the granting of the injunctive relief would upset Reese Foods'
                                    carefully developed distributorship policies and may very well result in injury to Reese Foods' sales and  [*641]
                                    product image. Apart from the fact the distribution policies have been in a state of change  [**76]  in recent years (a
                                    fact emphasized by defendants in another context), it does not appear to be plaintiffs' intent, or expectation, to harm
                                    the product image of Reese Foods.
                                    Quite to the contrary, plaintiffs want access to Reese Food products to aggressively market and promote their sale
                                    to retail customers. Fressie Reply Aff., para. 17. As indicated, Fressie is so confident of his ability to market Reese
                                    Foods products that he has stated: ""if, at the end of one year of free and open competition, Bascom is not buying
                                    and selling at least as much Reese product as the current lowest volume Reese distributor, [he] will surrender [his]
                                    shares to the corporation for nothing."" Fressie Reply Aff. para. 27. 31
                                    31 Plaintiffs have offered to make this undertaking a condition to the issuance of an injunction. Rule 65(c) HN22[
                                    ] requires a
                                    party seeking a preliminary injunction to post a security bond for the limited purpose of protecting the enjoined party from
                                    damages incurred as a result of the wrongful issuance of an injunction. Commerce Tankers v. National Maritime Union of
                                    America, 553 F.2d 793 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 923, 54 L. Ed. 2d 280, 98 S. Ct. 400 (1977). The amount of the bond is a
                                    matter within the discretion of the court. Similarly, the amount of damages awarded on a bond is discretionary, to be based on
                                    considerations of equity and justice. Kansas v. Adams, 705 F.2d 1267 (10th Cir. 1983). Courts may dispense with a bond or
                                    require only nominal bonds under certain circumstances. Where statutes provide that private actions be brought in the public
                                    interest, minimal amounts are often set by the court. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. Morton, 337 F. Supp. 167
                                    (D.D.C. 1971) (suit to enjoin government under National Environmental Policy Act - government asks bond of $ 750,000, bond
                                    set at $ 100).
                                    While the record suggests that a share of Reese Foods stock (which, when Reese Foods was founded on August 20, 1971
                                    Fressie paid ""a few hundred dollars"" for one share of stock) does not have a ready determinable value, there must be a way of
                                    determining the value. As indicated above, certain shareholders not complying with the shareholders agreement (i.e., Fien) have
                                    had their shares repurchased.
                                    In addition to the foregoing undertaking, plaintiffs will also post a bond in the amount of $ 50,000. The amount of a possible bond
                                    has not been addressed by the parties. While the amount established hereby appears to be reasonable, either side may object
                                    to the amount by filing a brief on or before June 9, 1989, with responsive briefs to be filed on or before June 16, 1989. If
                                    necessary, oral argument will be had (on the issue of the amount of the bond) on June 20, 1989.
                                    715 F. Supp. 616, *640; 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7087, **74
                                    
                                    
                                    [**77]  Because denial of the injunction will result in an irreparable injury to plaintiffs' business opportunities and the
                                    granting of it would not cause similar hardship to the defendants, the balancing of the hardships in this case is
                                    tipped decidely in favor of the plaintiffs. Indeed, the absence of any demonstrable hardship to the defendants
                                    resulting from supplying Fressie his pro rata share of Reese Foods products is a significant (although not the
                                    compelling) reason for granting injunctive relief pending an October, 1989 trial. Because plaintiffs will not be entitled
                                    to sell more than their appropriate percentage (based upon Fressie's percentage ownership of Reese Foods stock
                                    and the contractual commitments to non-shareholder/distributors) of specialty food products, defendants' argument
                                    that plaintiffs will destroy the Reese Foods name across the nation in the next five months is rejected.
                                    Conclusion
                                    Plaintiffs' request for affirmative injunctive relief is granted. Upon the posting of the bond set forth in footnote 31,
                                    Reese Foods (and, to the extent they exercise control over Reese Foods, the individual defendants) shall be
                                    required to supply plaintiffs a reasonable amount of  [**78]  Reese Foods products for resale by plaintiffs in any
                                    geographic area and to any class of customers. The ""reasonable amount"" of Reese Foods products to which
                                    plaintiffs will be entitled shall be determined, as indicated, with reference to Fressie's pro rata ownership of Reese
                                    Foods stock, the amount of products available and the amount of products committed by contract to non-
                                    shareholder distributors.
                                    SO ORDERED, this 1st day of June, 1989.

                                    Actions brought by attorneys general as parens patriae cannot be settled without court approval. 15 U.S.C.S. §
                                    15c(c). Although the statute does not specify the procedure for approval of settlements, other courts have adopted
                                    a two-step process. The court must first grant preliminary approval to the settlements, which then triggers a notice
                                    and claim period during which the parties make reasonable efforts to notify all potential beneficiaries of the
                                    settlement. Consumers who respond will then be allowed to file a claim, which the parties will evaluate. Consumers
                                    also have the option of rejecting the terms of the settlement by opting out or may file objections to the settlement,
                                    which the court will consider at the time motions for final approval are made. Distribution of funds follows final
                                    approval.

                                    In general terms, settlement agreements can be presumed fair if they are the result of good faith arms-length
                                    negotiations and the court sees no indications of collusion. The adequacy of a proposed settlement concerns the
                                    likelihood, and scope, of plaintiff's recovery on the merits after trial and the amount offered in the settlement. The
                                    court should also consider whether the proposed settlement violates public policy. At the preliminary approval
                                    stage, the court should not make any final determinations as to the fairness or adequacy of the proposed
                                    settlement, but instead should merely determine whether there is ""probable cause"" on these issues sufficient to
                                    submit the proposal to the consumers."

                                    Milburn, with whom Mr. Frank L. Crawford was on the
                                    brief, for appellants:
                                    The acquisition in 1899 by the Standard Oil Company of
                                    New Jersey of the stocks of the other companies was
                                    not a combination of independent enterprises.  [****8]
                                    All of the companies had the same stockholders who in
                                    the various corporate organizations were carrying on
                                    parts of the one business.  The business as a whole
                                    belonged to this body of common stockholders who,
                                    commencing prior to 1870, had as its common owners
                                    gradually built it up and developed it.  The properties
                                    used in the business, in so far as they had been
                                    acquired by purchase, were purchased from time to time
                                    with the common funds for account of the common
                                    owners.  For the most part the plants and properties
                                    used in the business in 1899 had not been acquired by
                                    purchase but were the creation of the common owners.
                                    The majority of the companies, and the most important
                                    ones, had been created by the common owners for the
                                    convenient conduct of branches of the business.  The
                                    stocks of these companies had always been held in
                                    common ownership.  The business of the companies
                                    and their relations to each other were unchanged by the
                                    transfer of the stocks of the other companies to the
                                    Standard Oil Company of New Jersey.
                                    The Sherman Act has no application to the transfer to,
                                    or acquisition by, the Standard Oil Company of New
                                    Jersey of the stocks of the various manufacturing and
                                    producing [****9]  corporations, for the reason that such
                                    transfer and acquisition were not acts of interstate or
                                    foreign commerce, nor direct and immediate in their
                                    effect on interstate and foreign commerce, nor within the
                                    power of Congress to regulate interstate and foreign
                                    commerce.  United States v. Knight, 156 U.S. 1; In re
                                    Greene, 52 Fed. Rep. 104.
                                    The contracts, combinations and conspiracies of § 1 of
                                    the Sherman Act are contracts and combinations which
                                    contractually restrict the freedom of one or more of the
                                    parties to them in the conduct of his or their trade, and
                                    combinations or conspiracies which restrict the freedom
                                    of others than the parties to them in the conduct of their
                                    business, when these restrictions directly affect
                                    interstate or foreign trade.  Purchases or acquisitions of
                                    property are not in any sense such contracts,
                                    combinations or conspiracies.  Contracts in restraint of
                                    trade are contracts with a stranger to the contractor's
                                    business, although in some cases carrying on a similar
                                    one, which wholly or partially restricts the freedom of the
                                    contractor in carrying on that business as otherwise he
                                    would.  Holmes, J., in Northern Securities Case, 193

                                    352.  Such contracts are invalid because of the injury to
                                    the public in being deprived of the restricted party's
                                    industry and the injury to the party himself by being
                                    precluded from pursuing his occupation.  Oregon Steam

                                    are combinations between two or more persons
                                    whereby each party is restricted in his freedom in

                                    The cases in which combinations have been held invalid
                                    at common law as being in restraint of trade deal with
                                    executory agreements between independent

                                    v. Powhatan Coal & Coke Co., 60 W. Va. 508.
                                    A conspiracy in restraint of trade is a combination of two
                                    or more to deprive others than its members of their
                                    freedom in conducting their business in their own way
                                    by acts having that effect.  A combination to boycott is a
                                    sufficient illustration.
                                    The Sherman Act did not enlarge the category of
                                    contracts, combinations and conspiracies in restraint of
                                    trade.  United States v. Trans-Missouri Association, 166

                                    restricting the freedom of each of the [****12]  members
                                    in the conduct of his or its business, or in the nature of
                                    conspiracies to restrict the freedom of others than their

                                    Securities Case, 193 U.S. 197, was a combination
                                    which, through the device adopted, restricted the
                                    freedom of the stockholders of two independent railroad
                                    companies in the separate and independent control and
                                    management of their respective companies.
                                    Purchases and acquisitions of property do not restrain
                                    trade.  The freedom of a trader is not restricted by the
                                    sale of his property and business.  The elimination of
                                    competition, so far as his property and business is
                                    concerned, is not a restraint of trade, but is merely an
                                    incidental effect of the exercise of the fundamental civil
                                    right to buy and sell property freely.  The acquisition of
                                    property is not made illegal by the fact that the
                                    purchaser intends thereby to put an end to the use of
                                    such property in competition with him.  Every purchase
                                    of property necessarily involves the elimination of that
                                    property from use in competition with the purchaser and,
                                    therefore, implies an intent to effect such elimination.
                                    Cincinnati Packet Co. v. Bay, 200 U.S. 179.
                                    [****13]  The transfer to, and acquisition by, the
                                    Standard Oil Company of New Jersey of the stocks of
                                    the various corporations in the year 1899 was not, and
                                    the continued ownership of those shares with the control
                                    which it confers is not, a combination or conspiracy in
                                    restraint of trade declared to be illegal by the first
                                    section of the Sherman Act.  Because of the common
                                    ownership of the different properties in interest they
                                    were not independent or competitive but they were the
                                    constituent elements of a single business organism.
                                    This situation was not affected by the transfer to the
                                    Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, who had the
                                    same body of stockholders and had controlled the
                                    separate companies and continued to control them
                                    through the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey.
                                    These considerations differentiate the present case from
                                    the Northern Securities Case, 193 U.S. 197. The
                                    Northern Securities Case dealt with a combination of
                                    diverse owners of separate and diverse properties
                                    which were bound by the law of their being as quasi-
                                    public corporations invested with public franchises to
                                    continue separate, independent and competitive,
                                    creating through the instrumentality of the holding
                                    company [****14]  a common control which would
                                    necessarily prevent competitive relations.
                                    There is no warrant for the assumption that corporations
                                    engaged in the same business are naturally or
                                    potentially competitive regardless of their origin or
                                    ownership.  If the same body of men create several
                                    corporations to carry on a large business for the
                                    economical advantages of location or for any other
                                    reason, and the stocks of these corporations are all in
                                    common ownership, it is a fiction to say that they are
                                    potentially competitive or that their natural relation is
                                    one of competition.
                                    The common owners of the Standard Oil properties and
                                    business had the right to vest the properties and
                                    221 U.S. 1, *1; 31 S. Ct. 502, **502; 55 L. Ed. 619, ***619; 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1725, ****10
                                    
                                    
                                    business in a single corporation, notwithstanding that
                                    such a transaction might tend to prevent the
                                    disintegration of the different properties into diverse
                                    ownerships.  The Sherman Act does not impose
                                    restrictions upon the rights of joint owners.
                                    The acquisitions prior to 1882 were lawful and their
                                    effect upon competition was incidental.  The purpose of
                                    the trust of 1879 was to bring the scattered legal titles to
                                    the joint properties then vested in various individuals
                                    into a single trusteeship.  The purpose of the
                                    Trust [****15]  Agreement of 1882 was to provide a
                                    practicable trusteeship to hold the legal title to the joint
                                    properties, an effective executive management and a
                                    marketable symbol or evidence of the interest of each
                                    owner.  The only question raised in the case of State v.
                                    Standard Oil Company, 49 Oh. St. 137, was whether it
                                    was Ultra vires for the Standard Oil Company of Ohio to
                                    permit its stock to be held by the trustees instead of by
                                    the real owners.  The method of distribution adopted on
                                    the dissolution of the trust was the only feasible plan of
                                    distribution.  Each certificate-holder was given an
                                    assignment of his proportionate interest in all the
                                    companies.  All being parts of the common business
                                    there was no basis for separate valuations.  The value
                                    of the interest of every owner was dependent upon its
                                    being kept together as an entirety.  The transaction of
                                    1899 was practically an incorporation of the entire
                                    business by the common owners through the ownership
                                    of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey.  That was
                                    the plain purpose, object and effect of the transaction.
                                    The first section of the Sherman Act deals directly with
                                    contracts, combinations and conspiracies in restraint of
                                    trade.  The [****16]  second section deals directly with
                                    monopolizing and attempts to monopolize.
                                    Monopolizing does not enlarge the operation of the first
                                    section nor does its absence restrict the operation of
                                    that section.
                                    The first section deals with entities, a contract,
                                    combination, a conspiracy; and the entities themselves
                                    are expressly declared to be illegal, and may be
                                    annulled or destroyed.  The second section deals with
                                    acts.
                                    At common law monopoly had a precise definition.
                                    Blackstone, Vol. 4, p. 160; Butchers' Union Co. v.
                                    Crescent City Co., 111 U.S. 756. Monopoly imports the
                                    idea of exclusiveness and an exclusiveness existing by
                                    reason of the restraint of the liberty of others.  With the
                                    commonlaw monopoly the restraint resulted from the
                                    grant of the exclusive right or privilege.  Under the
                                    Sherman Act there must be some substitute for the
                                    grant as a source of the exclusiveness and restraint
                                    essential to monopolizing.  The essential element is
                                    found in the statement of Judge Jackson ( In re Greene,
                                    52 Fed. Rep. 116) that monopolizing is securing or
                                    acquiring ""the exclusive right in such trade or commerce
                                    by means which prevent or restrain others from
                                    engaging therein."" Exclusion by competition [****17]  is
                                    not monopolizing.  Pollock on Torts, 8th ed., p. 152;

                                    Monopolizing within the act is the appropriation of a
                                    trade by means of contracts, combinations or
                                    conspiracies in restraint of trade or other unlawful or
                                    tortious acts, whereby ""the subject in general is
                                    restrained from that liberty of . . . trading which he had
                                    before."" In the absence of such means or agencies of
                                    exclusion, size, aggregated capital, power, and volume
                                    of business are not monopolizing in a legal sense.
                                    Swift v. United States, 196 U.S. 375, was the case of a
                                    combination of corporations, firms and individuals
                                    separately and independently engaged in the business,
                                    together controlling nearly the whole of it, to monopolize
                                    it by certain acts and course of conduct effective to that
                                    end when done and pursued by such a combination.

                                    acquisition of existing plants or properties however
                                    extensive, though made to obtain their trade and
                                    eliminate their competition, is not a monopoly at
                                    common law or monopolizing under the Sherman Act, in
                                    the absence of the exclusion of others from the trade by
                                    conspiracies to that end or contracts in restraint of trade

                                    monopolizing is present the remedy of the act is to
                                    prohibit the offending conspiracies, contracts, and illegal
                                    acts or means of exclusion, leaving the individual or
                                    corporation to pursue his or its business with the
                                    properties and plants that have been acquired or
                                    created shorn of the monopolizing elements in the
                                    conduct of the business.

                                    cannot be rendered unlawful by imputing to [****19]
                                    such acquisitions an intent to monopolize.  The
                                    acquisition of plants and properties does not exclude
                                    anyone from the trade and therefore the intent to
                                    monopolize cannot be attributed to such acquisitions.
                                    The proposition that an acquisition of property is
                                    rendered invalid because of a collateral intent to
                                    monopolize is not sustained by the authorities relied
                                    upon to support it.  Addyston Pipe Case, 85 Fed. Rep.
                                    291, and cases there cited.  The substantial acquisitions
                                    made by the owners of the Standard Oil business
                                    antedated the Sherman Act and they resulted from
                                    separate transactions extending over a long period of
                                    years.  They were in all cases accretions to an existing
                                    business.  They formed an insignificant part of the
                                    business as it now exists.  The Sherman Act is intended
                                    to prevent present monopolizing or attempts to
                                    monopolize.  Whether acquisitions made many years
                                    ago were or were not associated with an attempt to
                                    monopolize has no relation with the present attempt at
                                    monopolizing.
                                    The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey was not
                                    monopolizing, or attempting to monopolize, or
                                    combining with anyone else to monopolize, interstate
                                    and foreign trade in petroleum and its products [****20]
                                    when this proceeding was instituted, or at any time.
                                    The ownership of the pipe lines has not been a means
                                    of monopolizing.  Substantially all of the pipe lines
                                    owned by the Standard Oil companies have been
                                    constructed by those companies.  There has never been
                                    any exclusion of anyone from the oil fields either in the
                                    production of oil, or its purchase, or its storage, or its
                                    gathering or transportation by pipe lines.  Ownership of
                                    the pipe lines does not give the Standard companies
                                    any advantages in dealing with the producers which are
                                    not open to others.
                                    The decree erroneously includes and operates upon
                                    several of the appellant companies.
                                    The sixth section of the decree is unwarranted and
                                    impracticable in various of its provisions.
                                    It was error to deny the motion of the appellants to
                                    vacate the order permitting service upon them outside of
                                    the Eastern Division of the Eastern District of Missouri,
                                    and to set aside the service upon them of the writs of
                                    subpoena issued thereunder; and error to overrule the
                                    pleas of the appellants to the jurisdiction of the court
                                    over them.  The appellants were not residents of the
                                    Eastern District of Missouri nor were they found therein
                                    when the [****21]  order was made authorizing the
                                    service of process upon them outside of the district.
                                    There was no proceeding pending in that district
                                    involving a controversy for the determination of which
                                    the appellants were necessary parties.
                                    Mr. D. T. Watson, also for appellants:
                                    The Government has failed to maintain the affirmative of
                                    the issue made by the pleadings.  Brent v. The Bank, 10

                                    Stinson, 197 U.S. 200, 205.
                                    The transfer in 1899 to the Standard Oil Company of
                                    New Jersey of the various non-competitive properties
                                    jointly used by them as one property was not a
                                    restriction of interstate trade, or an attempt to
                                    monopolize, or a violation of the Sherman Act.
                                    The Sherman Act permits trusts, combines, corporations
                                    and individuals to enter into and compete for interstate
                                    trade so long as they act lawfully.  It does not seek to
                                    regulate the methods nor forbid those who enter into
                                    trade from doing their business in the form of a trust,
                                    corporation or combine, provided they carry it on
                                    lawfully.
                                    The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey after 1899
                                    might legitimately and properly compete for interstate
                                    trade, notwithstanding the combination [****22]  of the
                                    group of properties gave it a great power, only provided
                                    it did not restrain such trade or by unlawful means seek
                                    to gain a monopoly contrary to the provisions of the
                                    Sherman Act.
                                    There is nothing in this case to show that after 1899 the
                                    combination did unlawfully compete, restrict or seek to
                                    monopolize interstate trade; yet such evidence was
                                    indispensable to prove that the combination was
                                    violating the Sherman Act in 1906.See the Calumet &
                                    Hecla Case, Judge Kanappen, 167 Fed. Rep. 709, 715;

                                    There is a great difference between the Northern
                                    Securities Case and the case at bar.
                                    On the question of potential competition, the idea of
                                    competition between properties all owned by the same
                                    persons is a novelty.  The idea that properties
                                    themselves compete, and that if one man owns two or
                                    more he must compete with himself, is startling.
                                    Competition between joint owners is also novel.

                                    Competition is the striving of two or more persons, or
                                    corporations, either individually [****23]  or jointly, for
                                    one thing, i.e., trade; it is personal action; the strife
                                    between different persons.  Properties do not compete.
                                    Their relative locations may more readily enable their
                                    owners to use them in competition, but of themselves
                                    and as against each other, they do not compete.
                                    This idea makes the Sherman Act read that the same
                                    person or group of individuals shall not own and operate
                                    two or more sites for refineries or for stores or for any
                                    kind of manufactories which might be used by different
                                    owners in competition.  Joint Traffic Association Case,
                                    171 U.S. 505, 567.
                                    The words ""potential"" or ""naturally competitive"" are not
                                    in the Sherman Act.  Cascade Railroad Co. v. Superior
                                    Court, 51 Washington, 346. The rule of potential
                                    competition refers only to the ownership of the physical
                                    properties which produce the oil which goes into
                                    interstate commerce, and not to the oil itself.  United

                                    The Sherman Act is a highly penal one.  In a criminal
                                    prosecution under the act the degree of proof is beyond
                                    a reasonable doubt.  In a civil suit under it, the degree is
                                    not so great, but the proof [****24]  must be direct, plain
                                    and convincing.  United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight

                                    There is a distinction between private traders and
                                    railroad companies; and see also distinction under
                                    Sherman Act between quasi-public corporations and
                                    private traders.  Trans-Missouri Case, 166 U.S. 290.
                                    The mere method in which stocks are held is not
                                    prescribed by the Sherman Act; all methods are lawful if
                                    not used to restrict trade or gain an unlawful monopoly.
                                    Under the court's ruling the effectiveness of a large
                                    business organization may, by reason of that very fact,
                                    bring it under the Sherman Act.
                                    The decree below was not justified by the facts found by
                                    the court; or by the Sherman Act; after the court in § 5
                                    permitted the distribution among the shareholders of the
                                    Standard Oil Company of New Jersey of the stocks held
                                    by that company, it did without lawful authority so to do,
                                    define and limit the method of that distribution; restrict
                                    the distributees in the future sale, use and disposal of
                                    their stocks; restrict the distributees in the sale, use and
                                    disposal [****25]  of their properties; and in the contract
                                    relations thereafter to exist, as well as the use and
                                    disposition of the different properties in such a drastic
                                    manner as to greatly injure and destroy the value of the
                                    same and render their future profitable use practically
                                    impossible.  The decree disintegrates properties built
                                    with appellants' moneys for joint use so as to create
                                    units that never before existed and compels these units
                                    separately to carry on business and compete with other
                                    units, directly contrary to the purpose of their creation.  It
                                    allows the future operation and use of the refineries,
                                    pipe lines, and other properties of the appellants only
                                    under the vague and indefinite, but broad and
                                    comprehensive, terms of § 6 of the decree, by
                                    subjecting those who in the future operate them to
                                    attachment for contempt for unwittingly violating vague
                                    and indefinite terms.  It prohibits appellants from
                                    engaging in all interstate commerce until the
                                    discontinuance of the operation of the illegal
                                    combination, thus inflicting a new penalty for an
                                    indefinite and uncertain period.
                                    All of such restrictions are unauthorized by the Sherman
                                    Act, are in violation of the settled rules
                                    governing [****26]  injunctions, and are contrary to the
                                    provisions of the different decrees heretofore approved
                                    by this court under the Sherman Act, and especially the
                                    one in the Northern Securities Case.
                                    The decree authorized by the Sherman Act is wholly
                                    negative, and one that merely enjoins -- stops an illegal
                                    thing in operation when the petition is filed or which then
                                    is foreseen.  Lacassagne v. Chapius, 144 U.S. 124;

                                    Circuit, December 8, 1910.
                                    The Sherman Act prescribes certain specific methods of
                                    relief which are exclusive of all others.  Noyes on

                                    The decree hampers and greatly injures the value of the
                                    stock of the stockholders,  [****27]  though they are not
                                    parties to the bill.
                                    A corporation, when party to a bill in equity, does
                                    represent its stockholders, but only within the scope of

                                    The decree follows the appellants and their properties
                                    after the dissolution.
                                    The Sherman Act closely limits and defines the power of
                                    the court on a petition filed to give equitable relief.  The
                                    petition must pray that such violations shall be enjoined
                                    or otherwise prohibited; and it is these violations of the
                                    act that the court may now enjoin, and only such
                                    violations.  Past unlawful competition does not deprive
                                    parties of their right to conduct lawful competition.  New
                                    Haven R.R. Case, 200 U.S. 361, 404.
                                    The Sherman Act does not [****28]  give power to the
                                    courts to strike down and disintegrate a non-competing
                                    group of physical properties used to manufacture an
                                    article of trade.  These physical properties are bought
                                    and held and used under state laws; they do not enter
                                    into interstate commerce and hence are not under
                                    Federal control.  New Haven R.R. Co. v. Interstate Com.

                                    Co., 75 Nebraska, 637.
                                    The effect of the decree is ruinous.  For instance, these
                                    companies jointly own 54,616 miles of pipe lines, of
                                    which the seven individual defendants and their
                                    associates built over 50,000 miles, in which they have
                                    an investment of over $61,000,000.
                                    The decree splits up this pipe line system into eleven
                                    parts, takes away from the owners, who jointly built the
                                    pipe lines and who created the sub-companies, all
                                    control over the different sub-companies, and compels
                                    the eleven different parts to stand alone, independently
                                    of their principal and of each other, to be hostile to and
                                    to compete with their principal and with one another.
                                    Pipe lines are never parallel but always continuous, and
                                    each line has a value which depends wholly upon its
                                    connection with other parts of the system,  [****29]  and
                                    whether all are used together as one whole.  The
                                    carrying out of the decree would cut the pipe line system
                                    into isolated segments, prevent such use, and make the
                                    successful operation of the pipe lines impossible.
                                    The decree would especially destroy the value of the
                                    stock of all shareholders who each had five shares or
                                    less.  The stockholders on August 19, 1907, holding
                                    from one to four shares each numbered 1,157, and the
                                    stockholders owning five shares each numbered 439,
                                    out of a total number of 5,085 stockholders.
                                    Considering the case de novo, and not on the findings
                                    of the court below, it is not true that when the petition in
                                    this case was filed in 1906, the seven individual
                                    appellants and their associates, private traders in oil,
                                    were, contrary to the provisions of the Sherman Act,
                                    carrying on a conspiracy to restrain interstate and
                                    foreign trade in oils, and to gain by illegal means a
                                    monopoly thereof.
                                    The Federal law allowed and allows each of the
                                    individuals to compete freely for the interstate and
                                    foreign traffic in oil and its products.  He may use all the
                                    weapons that his ingenuity and skill can suggest, to
                                    wage a successful warfare.  His rights to compete are
                                    not [****30]  limited to merely such means as are fair or
                                    reasonable, but are only limited to such as are unlawful
                                    and directly tend to the violation of the Sherman Act.
                                    The Federal law also allows and assures to each
                                    competitor whatever share, however large, of the
                                    interstate or foreign trade in oil he or they may win
                                    provided his means are not unlawful.  The Sherman Act
                                    was passed to protect trade and further competition.  It
                                    makes such restraint and monopoly a crime and inflicts,
                                    on conviction, severe penalties for such offense.  It
                                    permits one set of competitors to purchase the property
                                    of other competitors solely to avoid further competition.
                                    The mere size of the competing corporations or
                                    combinations is immaterial.
                                    The monopoly of a trade at common law was forbidden
                                    because, and only because, it excluded all others from
                                    practicing such trade, and seems to have been then
                                    limited to a royal grant, as, for example, giving the
                                    exclusive right to manufacture playing cards.  It was and
                                    is a distinct thing from engrossing, regrating or
                                    forestalling the market, all of which were based on the
                                    prevention of artificial prices for the necessaries of life.
                                    No one of these falls under Federal jurisdiction,
                                    [****31]  but each is subject to state control only.
                                    The present litigation is between the Federal
                                    Government and certain of its citizens.The questions
                                    involved are solely the rights of these Federal citizens
                                    and the effect upon those rights of the Sherman Act,
                                    and whether these Federal citizens have violated the
                                    provisions of that act.
                                    There was and is no such thing as a Federal crime,
                                    221 U.S. 1, *1; 31 S. Ct. 502, **502; 55 L. Ed. 619, ***619; 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1725, ****27
                                    
                                    
                                    aside from express congressional acts, and as no such
                                    act was in existence prior to 1890, as to the matters
                                    charged in the petition, all the matters and things done
                                    by the defendants prior thereto are immaterial.
                                    This case involves, and only involves, the question of
                                    the restraint and monopolization of interstate and
                                    foreign trade in oil in November, 1906, when the petition
                                    was filed; it does not involve any alleged restraint or
                                    monopoly of the oil industry in any of the States.
                                    The appellants were lawfully entitled to so hold and use
                                    in interstate trade all of its combined properties.
                                    To succeed in this case, the Government must also
                                    show that the said Standard Oil Company was then in
                                    1906 using its power to actually restrain interstate or
                                    foreign trade in oil, or was then in 1906 excluding or
                                    attempting [****32]  to exclude by illegal means others
                                    from said trade and attempting to monopolize the same,
                                    or a part thereof.
                                    The Sherman Act does not compel private traders,
                                    however organized, to compete with each other.  The
                                    character of the oil business was and is such that a
                                    great corporation was and is an economic necessity for
                                    carrying on that industry.  The growth and success of
                                    the Standard Oil Company was the result of individual
                                    enterprise and the natural laws of trade.  It was not the
                                    result of unlawful means, but of skill, unremitting toil,
                                    denials and hardships, and is an instance of where the
                                    continuous use for forty years of skill, labor and capital
                                    reached a great success.
                                    To prove a violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act the
                                    Government must clearly show that when the petition
                                    was filed appellants were then actually restraining
                                    interstate trade in oil.
                                    To prove a monopoly under § 2 of the Sherman Act, the
                                    Government must show that the appellants were, when
                                    the petition was filed, then using unlawful means to
                                    maintain their control of the industry and that the
                                    appellants were then by unlawful means excluding
                                    others from said industry.

                                    It is immaterial that this conspiracy had its inception
                                    prior to the enactment of the Sherman Law, or that
                                    many of the rebates and discriminations granted by the
                                    railroads which enabled the defendants to monopolize
                                    the commerce in petroleum antedated the enactment of
                                    the Interstate Commerce Act; the principles of the
                                    common law applied to interstate as well as to intrastate

                                    From the earliest date these various corporations were
                                    held together by trust agreements which were void at
                                    common law.  But whether they were void or not, the
                                    combination was a continuing one; there was no vested
                                    right by reason of the acquisition of these
                                    stocks [****34]  by the trustees, and when the Sherman
                                    Act was passed the continuance of the combination
                                    became illegal.  United States v. Freight Association,

                                    The Standard Oil Company, through various defendant
                                    subsidiary corporations is engaged in producing and
                                    purchasing crude petroleum in Pennsylvania, West
                                    Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Oklahoma, Kansas and
                                    California; in transporting the same by pipe lines from
                                    the States in which the same is produced into the
                                    various other States to the manufactories of the various
                                    defendants; in manufacturing the same into the products
                                    of petroleum and transporting those products, largely in
                                    the tank cars of the Union Tank Line Company
                                    (controlled by the Standard Oil Company of New

                                    United States, and in selling and disposing of the same.
                                    This clearly makes the defendants engaged in interstate

                                    The Northern Securities Case and other
                                    authorities [****36]  cited under this head are conclusive
                                    of the proposition that this is a combination in restraint
                                    of trade.  The court held that the inhibitions of the
                                    Sherman Act were not limited to those direct restraints
                                    upon trade and commerce evidenced by contracts
                                    between independent lines of railway to fix rates or to
                                    maintain rates, or manufacturing or other corporations to
                                    limit the supply or control prices; that the power of
                                    suppression of competition and therefore of restraint of
                                    trade exercised or which could be exercised by reason
                                    of stock ownership and control of the various
                                    corporations, was as much in violation of the Anti-trust
                                    Act as direct restraint by contract.  There is nothing in
                                    the act which can be construed to prohibit the
                                    suppression of competition by reason of stock control of
                                    railways and at the same time to permit it in
                                    manufacturing industries, pipe line companies, or car
                                    line companies engaged in the manufacture and
                                    transportation of oil.  The contracts, combinations in the
                                    form of trusts or otherwise, or conspiracies in restraint of
                                    trade, which are inhibited by the first section of the act
                                    as applied to these classes of corporations cannot be
                                    distinguished from those [****37]  contracts,
                                    combinations in the form of trusts or otherwise, or
                                    conspiracies in restraint of trade, when applied to
                                    railway companies.  The thing inhibited is the restraint of
                                    interstate commerce.  The thing to be accomplished is
                                    the maintenance of the freedom of trade.  The inhibition
                                    against the suppression of competition by any
                                    instrumentality, scheme, plan or device, to evade the
                                    act, applies to all corporations and all devices.  The real
                                    point is not the instrumentality or the scheme used to
                                    suppress the competition, but whether competition is
                                    thus suppressed and trade restrained and monopolized.
                                    Nowhere in the decisions of this court is there authority
                                    for the proposition that combinations by stock ownership
                                    or the purchase of competing properties is invalid as to
                                    railroads but valid as to trading and manufacturing
                                    companies.  The act of Congress and the decisions of
                                    this court, so far as the principle goes, places them
                                    upon the same plane.  In the argument of the Freight
                                    Association cases it was urged by counsel that the
                                    inhibitions of the Sherman Act in this regard did not
                                    apply to railroads, but only included trading companies.
                                    It is now urged that they apply to railroads [****38]  and
                                    do not apply to manufacturing and trading companies.
                                    But this court in the Freight Association cases clearly
                                    laid down the rule that while there are points of
                                    difference existing between the two classes of
                                    corporations, yet they are all engaged in interstate
                                    commerce, that the injuries to the public have many
                                    common features, and that the inhibitions apply to all.
                                    166 U.S. 322.
                                    The transfer of the stocks of these companies in 1899 to
                                    the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey had no
                                    greater legal sanctity than the transfer to the trustees in
                                    1882, nor was it different from the transfer of the stocks
                                    of the Northern Pacific and Great Northern Railways to
                                    the Northern Securities Company in 1901, two years
                                    after the organization of the present corporate Standard
                                    Oil combination.  It is the usual course of reasoning
                                    urged in all of these trust cases -- because a person has
                                    a right to purchase property, he may therefore purchase
                                    a competitor, and because he may purchase one
                                    competitor he may purchase all of his competitors, and
                                    what an individual may do a corporation may do.  These
                                    were the identical arguments pressed with great ability
                                    by counsel in the Northern Securities Case and [****39]
                                    in the subsequent case of Harriman v. Northern
                                    Securities Co., 197 U.S. 291; but this court held to the
                                    contrary.  The position is also contrary to the almost
                                    universal trend of the American decisions both Federal
                                    and state.  The exercise of an individual right
                                    disconnected from all other circumstances may be legal,
                                    but when taken together with the other circumstances
                                    may accomplish the prohibited thing.
                                    The second section of the act prohibits a person or a
                                    single corporation from monopolizing or attempting to
                                    monopolize any part of the commerce of the country by
                                    any means whatever, and also from conspiring with any
                                    other person or persons to accomplish the same object.
                                    The two sections of the act were manifestly not intended
                                    to cover the same thing; otherwise the second section
                                    would be useless.  Any contract or combination in the
                                    form of a trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of
                                    trade which tends to monopoly is prohibited by the first

                                    The question then is: What is the meaning of the word
                                    ""monopoly,"" as used in the second section of the act?
                                    Of course Congress did not [****40]  have in mind
                                    monopoly by legislative or executive grant.  National
                                    Cotton Oil Co. v. Texas, 197 U.S. 129; Burrows v. Inter.

                                    Such monopolies could not exist in this country except
                                    by grant of Congress or the States, and it has been held
                                    that exclusive grants to pursue an ordinary legitimate
                                    business are void.  Butchers' Union Co. v. Crescent City
                                    Co., 111 U.S. 754. Neither did Congress have in mind
                                    an absolute monopoly.  This can only be obtained by
                                    legislative grant.In a country like ours, where everyone
                                    is free to enter the field of industry, no absolute
                                    monopoly is probable.It is sufficient to bring it within the
                                    act if the combination or the aggregation of capital
                                    ""tends to monopoly . . . or are reasonably calculated to
                                    bring about the things forbidden."" Waters-Pierce Co. v.
                                    Texas, 212 U.S. 86. Originally monopoly meant a grant
                                    by sovereign power of the exclusive right to carry on any
                                    employment.  The only act of exclusion was the grant
                                    itself.  If the grant was void, then there was no
                                    monopoly.  These monopolies were common in all
                                    monarchial countries.  Monopoly, however, came to
                                    have a broader meaning under the common law
                                    in [****41]  the later days, and expecially in the United
                                    States, and in order to arrive at what Congress intended
                                    by the act of 1890 it is important to understand the
                                    history of the times and the general understanding of
                                    monopoly as defined by the courts and the political
                                    economists, and the monopolies which were known to
                                    the people generally and against which Congress was
                                    legislating.  Prior to the passage of this law, the various
                                    trust cases had been decided, in which trusts, like the
                                    Standard Oil of 1882, had been held illegal because
                                    they tended to create a monopoly.  People v. North
                                    River Sugar Refining Co., 54 Hun, 354; State v.
                                    Nebraska Distilling Co., 29 Nebraska, 700; State v.
                                    Standard Oil Co., 49 Oh. St. 137. Various other
                                    decisions had defined monopoly as known in this
                                    country, -- such cases as Alger v. Thacher, 19 Pick. 51;
                                    People v. Chicago Gas Trust, 130 Illinois, 268; Salt Co.
                                    v. Guthrie, 35 Oh. St. 666; Craft v. McConoughy, 79
                                    Illinois, 346; Central R.R. Co. v. Collins, 40 Georgia,
                                    582.
                                    These cases were decided before the Sherman Act was
                                    passed, and defined monopoly at common law as it was
                                    understood and existed in this country.  They embrace
                                    trusts like the Standard Oil trust;  [****42]  agreements
                                    fixing prices, dividing territory, or limiting production,
                                    thereby tending to enhance or control the price of
                                    products; general agreements restraining individuals
                                    from engaging in any employment except as incident to
                                    the sale of property; purchases by corporations of all or
                                    a large proportion of competing manufacturing or
                                    mechanical plants; combinations of separate
                                    businesses in the form of partnership but really for the
                                    purpose of controlling the trade; and various other forms
                                    of acquiring monopoly.There was no unlawful exclusion
                                    of anyone else from doing business in these cases.
                                    They show that the term ""monopoly"" as applied in
                                    American jurisprudence meant monopoly acquired by
                                    mere individual acts, as distinguished from grant of
                                    government, although the individual act in and of itself
                                    was not illegal; the concentration of business in the
                                    hands of one combination, corporation, or person, so as
                                    to give control of the product or prices; as said by Mr.
                                    Justice McKenna, in the Cotton Oil Case, ""all
                                    suppression of competition, by unification of interest or
                                    management.""
                                    The case of Craft v. McConoughy, supra, well illustrates
                                    this argument.  The pretended copartnership
                                    formed [****43]  between the dealers of the town of
                                    Rochelle, while carrying on the business separately,
                                    enabled them to control the prices to the detriment of
                                    the surrounding country.  It was therefore a
                                    monopolizing or an attempt to monopolize a part of the
                                    commerce of the State; and the monopolization would
                                    have been just as effective had these separate business
                                    enterprises been stock corporations and the stock
                                    placed in the hands of a holding company.  A similar
                                    illustration was the case of Smiley v. Kansas, 196 U.S.
                                    447 (affirming 65 Kansas, 240), in which an attempt to
                                    control the grain trade of a particular station was held
                                    illegal under a state statute.  The Standard combination
                                    is an attempt to control and monopolize a vast
                                    commerce of the entire country, as these people
                                    undertook to control and monopolize a local commerce.
                                    The term ""monopoly,"" therefore, as used in the
                                    Sherman Act was intended to cover such monopolies or
                                    attempts to monopolize as were known to exist in this
                                    country; those which were defined as illegal at common
                                    law by the States, when applied to intrastate commerce,
                                    and those which were known to Congress when the act
                                    was passed.  The monopoly most commonly known in
                                    this [****44]  country, and which the debates in
                                    Congress 1 show were intended to be prohibited by the
                                    act, were those acquired by combination (by purchase
                                    or otherwise) of competing concerns.  The purchase of

                                    a competitor, as a separate transaction standing alone,
                                    was the exercise of a lawful privilege, not in and of itself
                                    unlawful at common law nor prohibited by statute, yet in
                                    the Northern Securities Case the purchase of stock in a
                                    railway was held to be illegal when done in pursuance of
                                    a scheme of monopoly.
                                    It is not necessary in this case, and we doubt whether in
                                    any case it is possible, to make a comprehensive
                                    definition of monopoly which will cover every case that
                                    might arise.  It is sufficient if the case at bar clearly
                                    comes within the provisions of the act.  We believe that
                                    the defendants have acquired a monopoly by means of
                                    a combination of the principal manufacturing concerns
                                    through a holding company; that they have, by reason of
                                    the very size of the combination, been able to maintain
                                    this monopoly through unfair [****45]  methods of
                                    competition, discriminatory freight rates, and other
                                    means set forth in the proofs.  If this act did not mean
                                    this kind of monopoly, we doubt if there is such a thing
                                    in this country.  The men who framed the Constitution of
                                    this country were familiar with the history of monopolies
                                    growing out of acts of the Government.  They guarded
                                    the people against these by constitutional provisions,
                                    but they left open the widest field for the exercise of
                                    individual enterprise, and it was the abuse of these
                                    personal privileges, made easy by state laws permitting
                                    unlimited incorporation, which gave rise to the evils that
                                    convinced the people of the necessity for the passage of
                                    the Sherman Anti-trust Act.  It was not monopolies as
                                    known to the English common law, but monopolies such
                                    as were commonly understood to exist in this country
                                    which that act prohibited.
                                    As a natural conclusion from the foregoing definition of
                                    monopoly by appellants' counsel they claim that the
                                    inhibitions of the second section are against the
                                    unlawful means used to acquire the monopoly, but that
                                    acquired monopoly is not illegal; therefore that the court
                                    can only restrain the means by which the monopoly was
                                    acquired,  [****46]  leaving the monopoly to exist.  We
                                    believe this to be an altogether too refined construction
                                    of the act.  If such be the true interpretation, the result
                                    would be that one could combine all the separate
                                    manufactures in a given branch of industry in this
                                    country by use of unlawful means such as
                                    discriminatory freight rates, but, if not attacked by the
                                    Government before it had obtained complete control of
                                    the business, its very size, with its ramifications through
                                    all the States, would make it impossible for anyone else

                                    the entire country and would be beyond the reach of the
                                    law.  It could, by selling at a low price where a

                                    absolutely control the business without itself suffering
                                    any loss; and yet the Government would be powerless
                                    to destroy the monopoly because the unlawful means
